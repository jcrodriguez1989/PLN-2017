        
          Background
          CDKL1 is a member of the cell division cycle 2 (CDC2)-related serine threonine protein kinase family and is overexpressed in malignant tumors such as melanoma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer.
        
        
          Objective
          This study aimed to evaluate whether CDKL1 can serve as a potential molecular target for colorectal cancer therapy.
        
        
          Materials and methods
          Expression of CDKL1 in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively. To investigate the role of CDKL1 in colorectal cancer, CDKL1-small hairpin RNA-expressing lentivirus was constructed and infected into HCT116 and Caco2 cells. The effects of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated CDKL1 downregulation on cell proliferation and invasion were assessed by CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, and tumorigenicity assays in nude mice. The effects of CDKL1 downregulation on cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, microarray method and data analysis elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenomenon.
        
        
          Results
          CDKL1 protein was overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues compared with paired normal tissues. Knockdown of CDKL1 in HCT116 and Caco2 significantly inhibited cell growth, colony formation ability, tumor invasion, and G1–S phase transition of the cell cycle. The knockdown of CDKL1 stimulated the upregulation of p15 and retinoblastoma protein.
        
        
          Conclusion
          CDKL1 plays a vital role in tumor proliferation and invasion in colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo and, thus, may be considered as a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.
        
      
    
      Introduction
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths.1 With current therapeutic approaches, the prognosis of CRC is yet dismal. The pathogenesis of CRC is complex and occurs through the successive aberrant expression of tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes in the adenoma–carcinoma sequence.2 Throughout the process, the most important genes for CRC development are p53, RAS, and APC.2 Thus, identifying these biomarkers, defining them, and elaborating their functions will be the key to curing the disease.
      The cyclin-dependent kinase-like 1 (CDKL1) gene, also known as P42 or KKIALRE, located on chromosome 14q21.3, encodes 2 isoforms (with 276 and 358 amino acids) of a protein kinase with a putative cell division cycle 2 (CDC2)-related serine/threonine domain.3,4 The CDKL family consists of 5 members. The mammalian CDKL1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, lungs, kidneys, and ovaries.3,4 Zebrafish CDKL1, sharing a high degree of homology with the mammalian ortholog, plays an essential role in zebrafish development, and interference of its expression results in brain malformation and body axis curvature.5 Human CDKL1 and CDKL5 were reported to play important functions in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorder.4,6 Recently, CDKL1 has been reported to be upregulated in melanoma and breast and gastric cancers.7–9
      Dysregulation of human kinases has frequently been linked to a variety of human malignancies, including cancer. As we know, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) can trigger cell cycle progression, and their dysregulation contributes to unscheduled proliferation during tumor development.10 High nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of CDK1 expression can predict poor prognosis in CRC patients.11 CDK8 is regarded as an oncogene of CRC that regulates β-catenin activity.12 Moreover, P57/Kip2 as an inhibitor of several cyclin–CDK complexes has been proven to be a tumor suppressor,13 and a variety of medications targeting CDKs have undergone clinical trials for gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia.14,15 As a mimic of CDKs, whether CDKL1 is involved in the progression of human CRCs is not clear, and although some studies have shown associations between CDKL1 expression and cancers,7–9 the signaling pathway of CDKL1 remains elusive.
      In this study, we have found that CDKL1 is overexpressed in CRC and its suppression by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits cell proliferation and invasion of CRC cells by impeding the cell cycle. Moreover, analysis of gene expression profiling after CDKL1 knockdown found several gene sets putatively involved in CRC progressions, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling, RNA transcription, enzyme inhibitor activity, and chromosome maintenance. Furthermore, we confirmed that the P15-Rb (retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein) pathway is related to CDKL1 knockdown. Taken together, our findings suggest that CDKL1 might be a potent oncogene in CRC and, therefore, may represent a new target for therapeutic intervention.
    
    
      Materials and methods
      
        Clinical samples and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
        The investigated specimens (tumors and paired normal tissues) were collected randomly from 100 CRC patients with radical colectomy between January 2008 and December 2009 conducted at the Department of General Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, People’s Republic of China. IHC was performed as described previously.16 All sections were scored blindly by 2 investigators under a light microscope and recorded. CDKL1 expression was estimated using the criterion specified on The Human Protein Atlas website,17 based on the multiplication of intensity and percentage of the stained cells. The tissue staining was scored as negative (−), slightly positive (+), moderately positive (++), and strongly positive (+++). Ethical approval was obtained from the clinical research ethics committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, People’s Republic of China). Written informed consent for the acquisition and use of tissue samples was obtained from all patients.
      
      
        Cell culture
        The CRC cell lines HT29, Caco2, SW480, SW620, RKO, Lovo, and DLD1 were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, People’s Republic of China), and HCT116 was obtained from KeyGen Biotech (Nanjing, People’s Republic of China). The HCT116 and HT29 cells were maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium (KeyGen Biotech); Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) was used for Lovo, SW480, SW620, RKO, and Caco2, whereas DLD1 cell line was maintained in RPMI-1640 (Corning, Manassas, VA, USA). The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C.
      
      
        Small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), plasmids, and cell transfection
        The shRNA target sequence (5′-AGCAAGTGTTTAGCACGAA-3′) for CDKL1 isotypes (NM_004196 and NM_001282236) was designed and constructed. Nonsense sequence (5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′) was designed and used as the shRNA control. CDKL1-shRNA and control-shRNA were cloned into GV115 plasmid vectors (GeneChem, Shanghai, People’s Republic of China) containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. Next, the plasmid vectors were packed into lentivirus particles. When the cells were confluent to 104 cells per well in 6-well plates, lentivirus particles with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 were added. The stably transfected GFP-expressing cells were detected using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and Western blotting was performed with CDKL1 antibody.
      
      
        CCK-8 assay
        Lentivirus-infected cells in the logarithmic phase were seeded into 96-well plates at the density of 2,000 cells per well (HCT116) or 6,000 cells per well (Caco2), and the plates were incubated in 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. The cell viability was assessed by the CCK-8 assay at several time points in the next 2 days. Briefly, 10 μL CCK-8 solution was added to the cells and incubated. The optical density (OD) of each well was measured at 450 nm using the CCK-8 plate reader (Epoch™; BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
      
      
        Colony formation assay
        The cells in the logarithmic phase were inoculated into 6-well plates at densities of 200 and 800 cells per well for HCT116 and Caco2, respectively. The medium was replaced every week. When the cell numbers in most of the single colonies were >50, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, People’s Republic of China) for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (BioSharp, Hefei, People’s Republic of China). After washing the cells with double-distilled water, the clusters were imaged and the number of colonies were counted.
      
      
        Transwell assay
        The assay was performed with precoated cell invasion kit (pore size 8.0 μm; Corning Inc, New York, NY, USA) and Matrigel (250 μg/mL; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) in transwell chambers. Cells at the density of 5×104 for HCT116 and 2×105 for Caco2 were then allowed to migrate from the medium chamber to that containing medium with 30% FBS in the lower chambers. The invaded cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde after 60 h of incubation and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The cells that invaded through the membrane were counted under a light microscope (4 random fields per well).
      
      
        Flow cytometry analysis
        Cell culture supernatants and adherent cells were harvested and washed with PBS by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm. Then, the cells were fixed with 70% ethanol at −20°C for 2 h and stained with propidium iodide (PI) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). After incubation for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, the cells were analyzed for DNA content using flow cytometry (FACS Aria; BD Biosciences). For the determination of apoptotic cell death, the cells were stained with Annexin V–APC (BD Biosciences) and PI, followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Pharmingen). Fluorescence compensation was conducted to exclude the overlapping of the emission spectra. A total of 50,000 events were acquired for analysis using ModFit LT 3.2 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA).
      
      
        Microarray and data analysis
        In order to detect the potential signaling pathways altered while knocking down CDKL1, we performed a gene expression profiling experiment using GeneChip Hybridization Oven 645, containing 22,000 probe sets (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Total RNA was prepared from control and RNAi DLD1 cells with TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA samples were quantified using NanoDrop 2000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Montchanin, DE, USA) and Agilent Bio-analyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The arrays were performed on GeneChip fluidics 450 workstation (Affymetrix) and GeneChip scanner 3000 (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Robust multichip analysis (RMA) was used for normalization to assess the level of background variability between hybridizations. In all the analyses, fold change (|FC|) was set as >2 and P-value as <0.01. Pathway and gene ontology analyses were carried out next. All microarray data, along with the design parameters, have been submitted to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO accession GSE94887).
      
      
        Western blot analysis
        Harvested cells were lysed, and the total protein was quantitated with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, People’s Republic of China). An equivalent of 40 μg protein extract was resolved using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Then, the blots were blocked with 5% milk, followed by incubation with the respective antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Fisher) and visualized with the Tanon-4500 Gel Imaging System (Tanon, Shanghai, People’s Republic of China). Tubulin, H3, and LaminB1 were used as internal controls. The antibodies used were as follows: anti-CDKL1 (1:1,000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-CDK4, anti-CDK6, anti-cyclinD1, and anti-LaminB1 (1:2,000, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA); horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:10,000, Abbkine, Wuhan, Hubei, People’s Republic of China); and anti-H3, anti-P15, anti-Rb, anti-phospho-Rb (Ser807/811), and anti-Phospho-Rb (Ser780) (1:2,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA).
      
      
        In vivo tumorigenicity assay
        Four-week-old male BALB/c mice were purchased from Shanghai Sippr-BK Laboratory Animal Co Ltd, Shanghai, People’s Republic of China. Six animals per group (4 groups: control and RNAi groups for HCT116 or Caco2 cells) were used in each experiment. Briefly, HCT116 or Caco2 cells (expressing control-shRNA or CDKL1-shRNA) in 100 μL PBS at 1×108 cells/mL were inoculated into the armpit of the mice. The tumors were measured weekly using a Vernier caliper, and the tumor volume was calculated using the formula π/6× length × width2.18 Tumors were collected 4 weeks after inoculation. All studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. All mice were handled according to the Use of Laboratory Animals and the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Care.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        CDKL1 expression in human tissues was analyzed by nonparametric analysis using the Wilcoxon test. All data were expressed as mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments, wherein each assay was performed in at least triplicates. The Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the differences between the control cells and CDKL1-knockdown cells using SPSS 17.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). P-values (2-sided) <0.05 were considered significant.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        CDKL1 is overexpressed in human CRC
        IHC was used for the detection of CDKL1 expression in the paraffin-embedded tissue samples of CRC patients (Figure 1). The results showed that CDKL1 protein was overexpressed in CRC tissue as compared to the adjacent normal tissue (P<0.01) (Table 1), primarily in the nucleus and less in the plasma. These results indicate that high levels of CDKL1 are present in CRC. Next, we searched for CRC cell lines that displayed high levels of CDKL1 expression. The expression of CDKL1 protein was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 2A). Thus, we selected HCT116 and Caco2 cells for subsequent assays.
      
      
        CDKL1 knockdown affects proliferation and invasion of CRC cells
        As a kinase, CDKL1 overexpression in CRC suggested that it might be required for cancer proliferation. First, we successfully carried out infection of HCT116 and Caco2 with lentivirus, as evident by the fluorescence microscopy results and the protein levels (Figure 2B and C). The CCK-8 assay revealed that the number of viable cells in the CDKL1-shRNA group decreased significantly as compared to the control group (P<0.01, Figure 3A and B). In addition, the colony formation assay was performed to determine the tumorigenesis in vitro. The cells were grown and allowed to form colonies 14 days after infection. Compared to the control group, the number of colonies in HCT116 and Caco2 cells of the CDKL1-shRNA group was decreased significantly (P<0.01, Figure 3C and D). Furthermore, by the transwell assay, we observed that the migratory potential of the cells was decreased significantly when endogenous CDKL1 expression was knocked down by CDKL1-shRNA vectors in both cell lines (Figure 3E and F). Following these results, we conclude a critical role for CDKL1 in the proliferation and migratory potential of CRC cells.
      
      
        CDKL1 facilitates the transition from G1 to S phase in CRC cells
        Considering that CDKL1 is related to CDKs, we examined the effect of CDKL1 silencing on cell cycle regulation in CRC cell lines. The cell cycle profiling by FACS indicated that silencing of CDKL1 expression with shRNA resulted in an increased number of cells in the G1 phase in HCT116 and Caco2 cells (Figure 3G and H). However, no consistency was observed in the distribution of G2 and S stages of the 2 cell lines. These results suggest that CDKL1 promotes the proliferation of CRC cells by facilitating the transition from G1 to S phase. Moreover, the apoptosis assay revealed that CDKL1-shRNA lentivirus exerts little influence on apoptosis in both cell lines (Figure 3I and J).
      
      
        CDKL1 knockdown inhibits colon tumorigenesis in vivo
        To examine the effects of the silencing of CDKL1 on tumor growth in vivo, CRC cells that stably expressed control-shRNA or CDKL1-shRNA were inoculated into the armpit of BALB/c mice. All the animals developed tumors 7 days after inoculation. Moreover, 28 days after inoculation, the tumors of the control-shRNA animals were significantly larger than those of the CDKL1-shRNA group (Figure 4A and B). The mean tumor volume was 725.53±200.02 mm3 in mice inoculated with HCT116 cells that expressed control-shRNA as compared to 149.44±155.10 mm3 in the CDKL1-shRNA group (Figure 4C). On the other hand, the mean tumor volume in the Caco2 group was 1,200.33±436.99 mm3 (control-shRNA) as compared to 307.73±76.83 mm3 (CDKL1-shRNA) (Figure 4D). These data demonstrate the important role of CDKL1 in promoting the growth of colon cancer cells.
      
      
        Multiple signaling proteins are activated by CDKL1-shRNA vector
        Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray identified that expression of 32 genes was upregulated while 21 genes were downregulated under the condition of |FC| >2 and P-value <0.01 (Figure 5A–C). Further analysis found that the gene sets involved in CDKL1 knockdown are components of TGF-β receptor signaling, cellular defense response, secretory pathway, RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity, enzyme inhibitor activity, chromosomes, membrane fractions, Toll pathway, pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, and spliceosomes. (Table 2) Next, Western blotting assay verified that knockdown of CDKL1 yielded a variably increased protein level of P15 (CDKN2B). Furthermore, examining the P15 cell cycle pathway molecules such as CDK4, CDK6, cyclinD1, Rb, and phosphorylated Rb revealed that total Rb was significantly upregulated after CDKL1 knockdown in both cell lines irrespective of CDK4/6 status, and cyclinD1 was upregulated in Caco2 (Figure 5D). However, the 2 cells shared no consistency on specific phosphorylation sites of Rb, such as Ser780 and Ser807/811.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      In the current study, the expression of CDKL1 protein increased significantly in tumor tissues as compared to the paired normal mucosa in CRC patients. It indicated that the high expression of CDKL1 might be correlated with CRC. Thus, to further explore the molecular function of CDKL1, we chose RNAi to disrupt the gene in human CRC cells and investigate the functional consequences. We found that the knockdown of CDKL1 led to inhibited proliferation, impaired cloning, lowered invasion ability, and stalled G1–S transition. Our study identified that CDKL1 may be a potential driver gene in CRC.
      Human cells harbor a large protein family composed of protein kinases, most of which are poorly studied, except CDKs.19 CDKs modulate the progression of the cell cycle by its sequential activation and inactivation.10,12 They are critical in regulating metabolism, cell division, and apoptosis by phosphorylation of diverse protein substrates. Their dysregulations directly or indirectly mediate unscheduled proliferation of most tumor cells. Human cells contain multiple CDKs, including CDK1, CDK2, and CDK4/6, several regulatory cyclins, as well as CDK inhibitors.20,21 For instance, CDK4/6 associates with cyclinD to regulate the cell cycle progression in the G1 phase; the complex senses cell mitogenic signals and prompts the cells to initiate DNA synthesis.10,14,20,22 The deregulation of these complexes has been implicated in a variety of cancers. Currently, in clinical practice, palbociclib is an orally administered cell cycle inhibitor, highly specific against CDK4/6.23 It can cause G1 cell cycle arrest and produce marked tumor regression in mice bearing human colon carcinoma.24 CDKL1 shares the same functional domains structurally as the CDKs, such as the cdc2 sequence features.3,5 The phylogenetic conservation of this molecule underscores their potential physiological similarity. Herein, we revealed that CDKL1 depletion led to an obvious arrest at the G0/G1 phase of CRC. Moreover, FACS results excluded the possibility that CDKL1 knockdown impedes CRC cell growth through apoptosis.
      To maintain G1 regulation, the activity of the CDK4/cyclinD complex is antagonized by CDK inhibitors such as the INK4 family, including INK4A, INK4B, INK4C, and INK4D, and the Cip and Kip family, composed of p21, p27, and p57.10,13,14 These cell cycle inhibitors have been shown to block proliferation of adult stem cells in multiple tissues. Among them, INK4B (P15) specifically inhibits the catalytic subunits of CDK4/6 involved in the regulation of G1–S phase transition.10,25 It is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and has been identified as a critical tumor suppressor.26,27 Thus, we decided to lay emphasis on P15 based on our microarray results after CDKL1 knockdown. Furthermore, we demonstrated that depletion of CDKL1 notably upregulated the protein expression of P15. P15 is shown to be a target of CDKL1 in CRC, either direct or indirect. However, further studies are essential for finding and verifying the partner or direct inhibitor of CDKL1. We also proved that as a downstream molecule of the P15 pathway, Rb is inhibited after CDKL1 knockdown. Rb is a well-known tumor suppressor in cell cycle regulation.28 Phosphorylation of Rb negatively regulates the cell cycle through E2F repression.29–31 However, Rb contains 13 conserved sites that are phosphorylated by the CDK–P15 complex in cycling cells and phosphorylation will cause site-specific and diverse conformational changes in the complex.32,33 Further studies need to be conducted to decipher the phosphorylated site of Rb related to CDKL1 knockdown. We found that the downstream molecules of P15 pathway such as cyclinD1 were inconsistent among HCT116 and Caco2, which may explain the different cell cycle distribution (S and G2 phases) between the 2 cell lines; however, further investigation is imperative. The MAPK pathway regulates diverse cellular functions including cell migration and is dysregulated in a variety of cancers.34 Our microarray results showed that DUSP1 and JUN, as 2 important molecules of the pathway, were dysregulated; this may lead to the attenuation of the invasion of CRC cells after CDKL1 knockdown. In addition, in the literature, there are no data relating CDKL1 with tumor invasion, so further experiments are required.
    
    
      Conclusion
      CDKL1 is a molecule of the complex cell cycle regulation network. Our study proves that CDKL1 expression contributes to CRC progression. The underlying mechanisms of CDKL1 activity and its substrates may lead to its use as a potential therapeutic target for CRC patients.
    
  
        The “Hypoxia Nantes 2016” organized its second conference dedicated to the field of hypoxia research. This conference focused on “the role of hypoxia under physiological conditions as well as in cancer” and took place in Nantes, France, in October 6–7, 2016. The main objective of this conference was to bring together a large group of scientists from different spheres of hypoxia. Recent advances were presented and discussed around different topics: genomics, physiology, musculoskeletal, stem cells, microenvironment and cancer, and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the major highlights of the meeting.
      
    
      Introduction
      Maintenance of oxygen homeostasis is a fundamental physiological challenge. Dysregulation of homeostasis with a consequent hypoxia is a component of many human diseases. Transcriptional response to hypoxia is mediated by hypoxia inducible factors (HIF1–3), the oxygen-sensitive signal being generated by a series of protein hydroxylases that catalyze prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation on specific residues in the regulatory HIF-α subunits (HIF1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α). Mammalian HIF-α subunits contain two hydroxylation sites called NODD (N-terminal Oxygen-dependant Degradation Domain) and CODD (C-terminal Oxygen-dependant Degradation Domain). In the presence of oxygen, prolyl hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD1–4) directs HIF-α for proteasome destruction following binding by the product of the tumor suppressor gene von Hippel–Lindau (pVHL) and ubiquitination (Figure 1).1,2 In addition, asparaginyl hydroxylation by factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) blocks recruitment of HIF co-factors. The HIF hydroxylases belong to two distinct groups of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent dioxygenase, which split O2 and couple oxidation (hydroxylation) of HIF-α to oxidative decarboxylation of 2-OG to succinate and CO2. PHD2, in particular, has been described to play a dominant role in oxygen sensing.3,4 In the absence of oxygen, hydroxylases are inhibited, HIF-α factors are stabilized, enter the nucleus, and associate with HIF-β subunits (ie, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocators ARNT1 or ARNT2) and cofactors (p300). These complexes form active transcription factors that bind hypoxia responsive elements (HREs) and drive the expressions of more than hundred target genes.5,6 These transcripts encode proteins that play a role in multiple biological pathways (cell survival, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, metabolism, etc).7,8 The panel of genes expressed in different cell types is specific, and their regulation by different HIF isoforms is complex and still puzzling. In the meeting, Prof P Ratcliffe and Prof I Ragoussis presented recent pan-genomic studies that revealed some aspects of the hypoxia pathway complexity.
    
    
      Complexity of the Hypoxia pathway
      
        Complex HIF hydroxylase modulation and transcriptional architecture of HIF-1α versus HIF-2α binding
        Prof P Ratcliffe provided an overview of the HIF hydroxylase pathway and considered opportunities and challenges in its therapeutic modulation, specifically whether it might be possible (and advantageous) to modulate specific components of the pathway under specific clinical settings. The evolution of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase pathway was outlined, highlighting the primitive PHD2/HIF-1α/VHL triad.9 Of particular relevance to the question of specific therapeutic modulation is the appearance of multiple HIF and PHD isoforms, through gene duplication events at the base of vertebrate evolution.10 This raises a question as to what extent these different isoforms have particular functions in the specialized oxygen delivery systems (the blood, vascular, and cardiopulmonary systems) of vertebrates, which are often the target of diseases. As a paradigm, the question of whether PHD inhibition could generate medically useful, isoform specific, activation of HIF-1α versus HIF-2α was considered.
        Although the differential regulation of HIF-α isoforms is not completely understood, they demonstrate differential dependence on each of two prolyl hydroxylation sites in the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of their oxygen-dependent degradation domains (NODD and CODD).11 Thus, inhibitors that operate differentially on the hydroxylation of each of these sites might impart at least partial HIF-α isoform selectivity. Initial evidence that this might be possible has been provided by the action of human mutations in PHD2, some of which generate striking differences in hydroxylation of HIF-1α NODD versus CODD.12 The feasibility of generating relatively specific inhibitors is also supported by differences in the binding of human NODD and CODD to PHD212 and from the ability of some, but not all, PHD inhibitors to displace CODD substrate as well as 2-OG from PHD2.13 All the PHDs, and ~60–70 other human dioxygenases in this family, use 2-OG as co-substrate; hence, inhibitors that simply act as 2-OG analogs are unlikely to be highly specific.14 Thus, it was argued that greater efforts would be required to develop substrate specific inhibitors and that at least some selectivity would likely be feasible.
        In light of this, recent work on the functional differentiation of HIF-1α versus HIF-2α was considered from two contrasting perspectives: 1) transcriptional biology, as assessed by pan-genomic assays of the HIF transcriptional response using ChIPseq and RNAseq analyses, and 2) the integrated physiology of hypoxia, assessed in recombinant mice bearing inactivating alleles of HIF-1α and HIF-2α.
        As an example of HIF-α isoform-specific actions on integrated physiology, recent work on erythropoiesis and ventilator sensitivity to hypoxia was considered.15,16 Increased erythropoiesis and enhanced ventilator sensitivity to hypoxia are key physiological components of the process of acute acclimatization. Direct comparison of conditional inactivation of HIF-1α with HIF-2α in adult life (as a surrogate for potential actions of specific pharmacological intervention) reveals marked specificity for the HIF-2α isoforms, at least under the conditions of experimental testing.15,16 This is consistent with, and likely in part driven by, contrasting patterns of expression. HIF-2α is expressed at much higher levels in the renal erythropoietin-producing fibroblasts and in the type 1 cells of the carotid body.17,18 Thus, it might be concluded that specific activation of HIF-2α would be of value in therapeutic strategies that aimed to augment these responses (ie, in the correction of anemia or in the stimulation of ventilation).
        As a counterpoise to this work, recent insights into the transcriptional biology of HIF were then considered from the perspective of pan-genomic studies that contrast patterns of HIF1α and HIF-2α at transcriptional target loci. These studies have defined distinct, though partially overlapping, sets of DNA binding sites for HIF-1α and HIF-2α.19 Depending on the level of analytical stringency applied, each isoform binds at hundreds to a few thousand sites, at levels sufficient to have an effect on transcription. No differences for HIF-1α versus HIF-2α are seen in consensus binding sequences. However, marked differences are observed across the genome in the distribution of binding at >106 potential hypoxia response elements in open chromatin. Gene ontology programs define differences in the functional pathways associated with gene loci that preferentially bind HIF-1α or HIF-2α, but these are generally not tightly demarcated; rather moderate pathway bias is observed in one or other isoform.20 Interestingly, significant biases are also observed in the type of transcriptional target, with HIF-2α showing greater enrichment than HIF-1α at loci associated with long non-coding RNAs.21 However, the most striking differences are observed in the distance between the HIF-α binding sites and gene promoters.20,22 HIF-1α is much more frequently bound close to promoters, with HIF-2α being more commonly bound at a distance from promoters. Moreover, even when both the HIF-α isoforms bound close to a promoter, functional studies reveal that it is generally HIF-1α that mediates the transcriptional response.23 Thus, when considered both are considered at the level of transcriptional biology and in the setting of integrated physiology, HIF-2α manifests features consistent with it being the “modern” isoform. HIF-2α mediates several of the adaptive responses to hypoxia that are specific to higher animals; it binds and functions at greater distances from its target genes, its expression is more cell-type specific, and it exhibits more frequent interactions with non-coding RNA networks. However, none of these properties is absolutely specific.
        In the discussion, it was speculated that this lack of clear organization was a fundamental reflection of Darwinian evolution, in which mutations are generated agnostically and alter specific biochemical processes, but selection is applied to the performance of integrated physiological systems. This process runs counter to the aim of dissecting highly specific drug targets out of complex systems. The conclusions were that the development of more specific HIF hydroxylase inhibitors, which target components of the HIF pathway with moderate levels of selectivity, would be feasible. Nevertheless, accurate predictions about what might or might not be useful in a specific medicinal situation remain difficult. The development of multiple inhibitors with diverse kinetic and chemical properties, coupled careful testing in physiological models, and (ideally) human experimental medicine studies, would be an ideal approach to this new area of medicine development.
      
      
        Complex expression of genes in hypoxia identified by RNAseq
        A major part of the adaptive response to hypoxia is mediated through transcriptional regulation, with the HIF transcription factors taking central stage. As presented by Prof I Ragoussis, the detailed study of the transcriptional response is conditional upon developing and applying genomic technologies that allow the global characterization of a wide universe of transcripts in the cell. Methodological developments utilizing the power of short read next generation sequencing technology have been applied, which allow the analysis of long and short transcripts following the removal of the highly abundant ribosomal RNA, while also retaining information on transcriptional orientation. Thus, for the first time, it was possible to identify global transcriptional changes under hypoxia in all classes of coding and non-coding RNAs, including small RNAs.21 As a result, our understanding of the transcriptional response to hypoxia is greatly enhanced and now covers the entire spectrum of RNAs, coding and non-coding, regulatory, microRNAs, t-RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and others. In addition, through the integration of ChIP data produced using antibodies against HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-1β, and PolII as well as the histones H3K4Me3 and H3K4me1, it was possible to determine that poised PolII is localized at the promoters of both coding and non-coding transcripts, the increased transcription of which is associated with HIF binding.21 More recently, this binding has been determined to take place at pre-existing promoter, promoter–enhancer, and enhancer–enhancer interactions using chromatin conformation assays.23 The role of long non-coding RNAs in hypoxia response is now the focus of intense research.24 Typical examples include HIF-2α regulated lncRNA NEAT1 that leads to the identification of paraspeckle formation as a response to hypoxia25 in breast cancer cells, whereas H19 is found to play a role in cell cycle in hypoxic HUVEC cells.26
        There is good evidence that alternative splicing contributes to a substantial part of the hypoxic response and is also directly regulated by HIF and can lead to the production of non-coding mRNA isoforms implicated in upregulated genes.27–30 Sena et al27 observed a dichotomy between high frequency of exon inclusion in hypoxia up-regulated genes, whereas exon exclusion was found predominant in downregulated genes using HEP3B cells. Following that, Memon et al29 observed that there is a major switch to non-coding isoforms in hypoxic HTCC116 human colon carcinoma cells, which was recapitulated in a large set of colorectal cancer samples from TCGA. More work is needed in a wider range of tissues and cancers in order to confirm the observations related to HIF’s role in splicing, the trends related to up- or down-regulated transcripts and any pathway-specific splicing effects, but it is clear that alternative splicing plays a major role in the hypoxia response.
        In terms of technological developments, inferring alternatively spliced isoforms of genes from short read data through statistical assignment of the most probable combination of exons is still computationally challenging and not very accurate. New, single molecule sequencing technologies are now enabling the direct sequencing of complete cDNA or even RNA molecules and their application31,32 has the potential to allow the characterization of the hypoxia transcriptome at even higher resolution.
      
    
    
      Hypoxia pathway in physiology and therapies
      In the meeting, sessions were dedicated to the physiological aspects of hypoxia. In fact, the physiological reaction to low oxygen induces adaptation and is essential to cell survival. As described earlier, the HIFs induce the expression of hundred of genes that play roles in many biological pathways.
      
        Role on glucose and lipid metabolism
        Prof P Koivunen presented HIF target genes and use of mouse models to study the connection of HIF with glucose and lipid metabolism. In agreement with a key role of hypoxia in lipid metabolism, genetic inhibition of Phd2 has recently been shown to reduce body weight and the amount of white adipose tissue (WAT) in mice.33 These mice hypomorphic for Phd2 also had smaller adipocytes, less WAT inflammation, and better glucose tolerance, and did not develop insulin resistance when fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or aged.33 Moreover, they had lowered serum cholesterol levels and an improved high density lipoprotein (HDL)/low density lipoprotein (LDL) + very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol ratio and were protected against steatohepatitis.33 The molecular-level determinants of the phenotype were upregulation of the HIF-1α target Glut1 and Glut4 mRNAs, several enzymes of glycolysis and Pdk1 mRNA in several tissues, downregulation of some inflammatory mRNAs in WAT and upregulation of the insulin sensitivity increasing, HIF2α target Irs2 mRNA and the concomitant downregulation of the lipogenesis regulating Srebp1c mRNA and its downstream targets Fas, Acca, and Scd1 in the liver.33,34 Mice deficient for Phd2 in adipose tissue also showed resistance to HFD-induced obesity and had a better glucose tolerance.35 In another study, knockout of Phd2 in adipocytes blunted lipolysis and increased intracellular lipid storages, therefore reducing ectopic lipid deposition.36 When wild-type mice were treated with a pharmacological PHD inhibitor FG-4497, obesity and metabolic syndrome opposing phenotype was observed.33 In support of these data, clinical trials with two different PHD inhibitors, FG-4592 (Roxadustat) and GSK1278863, for the treatment of anemia and peripheral vascular disease, respectively, report lowered serum cholesterol levels and an improved HDL/LDL profile with the subjects treated with the inhibitors.37,38 Dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome predispose to atherosclerosis. Recent data from mice associate inhibition of PHDs 1 and 2 with protection against atherosclerosis.34,39 The mechanisms involved were HIF-mediated modifications to metabolism including that for cholesterol, reduced inflammation, and beneficial alterations to the immune system.34,39 Although metabolic syndrome and the connected diseases are highly associated with life style only a minority of patients succeed in its improvement and end up in medication. Recent data provide evidence for justification to explore PHD inhibitors and activation of the endogenous hypoxia response pathway, to treat obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and atherosclerosis.
      
      
        Role on musculoskeletal system
        Prof J Myllyharju presented another example of the physiological role of the hypoxia pathway, related to the regulation of extracellular matrix homeostasis.40 The presentation focused on the roles of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4Hs) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) in the musculoskeletal system. Indeed, HIF induces the expression of several key enzymes such as CP4Hs, lysyl hydroxylases, and LOX that are required for proper collagen synthesis and assembly, and hence correct structure and function of connective tissues.41,42 Remodeling of extracellular matrix by these collagen-modifying enzymes has recently been shown to be important in hypoxic cancer metastasis.43,44 C-P4Hs are essential enzymes for collagen synthesis as the modifications catalyzed by these enzymes are required for thermal stability of collagens at body temperature. The C-P4H family consists of three isoenzymes, C-P4Hs I and II being the major forms.41 CP4H-I is expressed ubiquitously, whereas C-P4H-II has a more restricted expression pattern, being a prominent form in for example chondrocytes and osteoblasts.41 It has been shown that HIF-1α-regulated induction of C-P4Hs is necessary for sufficient collagen production in a hypoxic tissue environment such as, for example, in the cartilage chondrocytes.45 Studies with gene-modified mice lines have shown that c-P4h-1−/−mice die during early embryogenesis because of nonfunctional assembly of collagen IV into basement membranes.46 Reduced C-P4H activity in c-P4h-1+/−/c-P4h-2−/−double mutant mice leads to several connective tissue abnormalities. These include abnormal development of cartilage and bone resulting in structural and biomechanical impairment of these tissues and chondrodysplasia.47 Similar, but much milder abnormalities are present in the c-P4h-2−/−single mutant mice.47 As no signs of uncompensated endoplasmic reticulum stress were observed in these mice, the main cause of the chondrodysplasia is likely to be aberrant mechanosensing and signaling cues mediated by the abnormal extracellular matrix.47 Another collagen-modifying enzyme highly induced by HIF is LOX that catalyzes crosslink formation in collagen fibrils and elastin and affects the maturation, turnover, and stiffness of connective tissue.42 LOX is the major isoenzyme of the LOX family.42 It has been shown that lack of LOX interferes with the development of several connective tissues resulting in dysfunction of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, aortic aneurysms, and perinatal lethality in mouse.48,49 Interestingly, it has been shown recently that muscle composition is regulated by a LOX–TGFβ feedback loop. Lack of LOX was found to lead to excess expression of TGFβ that disrupts the balance between the amounts of myofibers and that of muscle connective tissue.50 This results in short and small muscles with reduced amount of myofibers and abnormal muscle patterning.50 Remarkably, this abnormal muscle development could be rescued by TGFβ inhibition.50 The regulatory effect of LOX on TGFβ signaling may be explained by either direct interaction between LOX and TGFβ or its receptor and/or increased susceptibility of insufficiently crosslinked collagens and elastin to proteolysis, which could result in elevated liberation of TGFβ from the extracellular matrix reservoir of the Lox−/− tissue.50
      
    
    
      Hypoxia pathway in pathology and therapies
      The meeting dedicated a session to the pathological aspect of hypoxia. The oxygen-sensing pathway may be dysregulated with a consequent constitutive activation of HIF transcription factors and target genes expression as observed, for example, in many types of tumors. The hypoxia pathway participates and sometimes initiates progression of a vast majority of tumors. The causes of HIF stabilization are wide-ranging, from a chronic hypoxic microenvironment to mutations in direct key regulator genes. The causes may also be indirect with the inhibition of hydroxylases by the production of 2-OG mimetics (following mutations in metabolic enzymes) or by oxidation (modification of the redox status, oxidation of co-factors, etc).
      
        Example of chondrosarcoma
        Prof J Bovée presented chondrosarcomas as an example of tumors linked to hypoxia. Chondrosarcoma is the second most frequent primary bone malignancy, predominantly affecting adults. They usually arise from their benign precursor lesions: 1) peripheral chondrosarcoma arising in osteochondroma (at the surface of bone, with mutations in exostosin genes EXT1 or EXT2 encoding glycosyltransferases involved in heparan sulphate biosynthesis) and 2) central chondrosarcoma arising in enchondroma (in the medulla of bone, with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 or IDH2). The prognosis is strongly correlated with histological grading. Grade I chondrosarcoma, now reclassified as an atypical cartilaginous tumor, is poorly vascularized, behaves locally aggressive, but typically does not metastasize. High-grade chondrosarcomas (grades II and III) have an increased vascularity and increased metastases corresponding to poor patient survival. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. If the tumor location is non-resectable or metastatic, there is still no curative treatment.51,52 Chondrosarcoma is notorious for its primary resistance to conventional chemo- and radiotherapy. 51,53 A multistep genetic model has been devised: while specific mutations (IDH, EXT) cause the benign precursor lesions, high-grade chondrosarcomas have complex karyotypes54 with many additional mutations.50 Since cartilaginous tissue as well as chondrosarcomas has a hypoxic microenvironment,55 it has been hypothesized that hypoxia is involved in chondrosarcoma aggressiveness, and this is supported by the increased microvessel density, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and HIF-1α levels in high-grade chondrosarcoma as compared to low grade.56,57 Interestingly, mutations in the IDH genes are found in up to 80% of enchondromas and ~50% of chondrosarcomas. IDH is involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Mutations in IDH lead to the formation of a neoenzyme that catalyzes the reduction of 2-OG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG),58 which is considered an oncometabolite and inhibits some α ketoglutarate dependent oxygenases. Regarding the effect of D2HG on prolyl hydroxylase and HIF pathway, mutations in IDH were first shown to associate with stabilization of HIF-1α,59 but later it was shown that D2HG produced by these mutations is not a potent PHD inhibitor.60,61 An inhibitory effect of D2HG has been demonstrated on the dioxygenase tenelevan-translocation-2 (TET2),62 a dioxygenase that catalyzes hydroxylation of methylated DNA. This results in inhibition of DNA demethylation, causing hypermethylation,62,63 and altered histone60 that impacts tumor progression.
      
      
        Example of Mn porphyrin-based redoxactive drugs as anticancer therapeutics
        Some aspects of anticancer therapies have been presented during the meeting. Notably, Prof I Batinic-Haberle focused on manganese (Mn) porphyrin-based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics as anticancer therapeutics. Porphyrins are molecules that comprise the active site of numerous key enzymes (hemoglobin, myoglobin, prolyl hydroxylase, cyt P450 oxidases, nitric oxide synthases, oxygenases, etc). These enzymes contain macrocyclic protoporphyrin ring that encapsulates iron and affords extreme stability to iron complex.
        Batinic-Haberle, Spasojevic, Tovmasyan, and other collaborators have developed very stable and redox-active manganese porphyrins (MnPs) as powerful mimics of superoxide dismutase (SOD) family of enzymes.64–66 They have mimicked the nature in its use of iron protoporphyrin as active site of different proteins to run major metabolic functions such as oxygen transport and detoxification among those. Yet, instead of protoporphyrin bound to iron, MnP-based SOD mimics have N-substituted pyridylporphyrins bound to manganese. MnPs exhibit remarkable ability to protect normal tissue from radiation (RT)-induced damage, such as brain, salivary glands, mouth mucosa, colon, eye, prostate, hematopoietic stem cells, and lung. Moreover, MnPs are powerful tumor radio-and chemosensitizers as demonstrated with lymphoma and tumors of brain, breast, head and neck, ovary, and prostate. Based on differential properties of MnPs to protect normal while killing cancerous tissues, two lead compounds, MnTE-2-PyP5+ and MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, progressed to Phase I/II clinical trials, the latter at Duke University.
        MnPs as mimics of superoxide family of enzymes also react with numerous other reactive species (RS) such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−), nitric oxide (.NO), and hypochlorite (ClO−) (reviewed in64–66). The actions of MnPs are also H2O2-driven and are frequently coupled with cellular reductants such as ascorbate, glutathione (GSH), and protein thiols. Although they have insignificant catalase-like activity, MnPs possess GSH peroxidase and thiol oxidase-like activities. The magnitude of all actions of MnPs thus far studied, including SOD-like activity, parallels the magnitude of their therapeutic efficacies and is dependent upon the metal-centered reduction potential of MnIIIP/MnIIP redox couple; in turn the magnitude of those actions parallels each other. In addition to reacting with different RS, MnPs inhibit activities of several transcription factors, such as HIF-1α, NF-κB, AP-1, SP-1, and Nrf2, thereby affecting cellular apoptotic and proliferative pathways.64–66 The nature of such interactions has mostly been explored with respect to NF-κB and has been ascribed to MnP-catalyzed and H2O2/GSH-driven oxidation/S-glutathionylation of thiols in its p50 and p65 subunits. Preliminary data also indicate the major role of Nrf2 in the actions of MnPs.
        MnPs exhibit differential effects to normal and tumor tissues presumably by impacting NFκB/HIF-1α/Nrf2 pathways.64–66 The HIF and NF-κB pathways are closely related. Hypoxia contributes to the development of inflammation, at least in part through the activation and/or potentiation of NF-κB, a master regulator of genes involved in innate immunity, inflammation, and apoptosis.67,68 The differential effects of MnPs on these pathways arise from different redox environments and diverse accumulation of MnPs in those tissues. In normal cells/tissues, MnPs reduce inflammation. For example, in a rat pulmonary radioprotection study, MnPs suppressed RT-induced lung inflammation through the inhibition of HIF-1α activation and downregulation of its target gene VEGF, which seemed to be controlled by NF-κB.69,70
        The cancer cell, though, relative to the normal cell, has excessive levels of endogenous H2O2, and thereby is often under oxidative stress and sensitive to any further increase in oxidative stress. This is due to its perturbed redox environment, often with increased MnSOD levels but insufficient levels and/or activities of peroxide-removing enzymes.64–66 Such situation has been heavily exploited in anticancer therapies, one of which includes MnP alone and/or combined with exogenously imposed oxidative stress. MnP, when administered at high concentration, exhibited an anticancer effect in its own right in a 4T1 breast cancer mouse model,71 where large inhibition of HIF-1α activity (presumably orchestrated through oxidation and subsequent inactivation of NF-kB) contributed to the suppression of angiogenesis. In the same model, the anticancer effect of MnP was further enhanced when it was given jointly with exogenous sources of H2O2 – RT, chemotherapy, or ascorbate.64 Furthermore, the massive MnP/H2O2/GSH-driven suppression of anti-apoptotic NF-κB was demonstrated in a cellular lymphoma model where lymphoma cells were exposed to MnP and dexamethasone.69,72 In addition, complexes I and III of mitochondrial respiration were S-glutathionylated, and in turn inactivated, resulting in the loss of ATP.
        The excessive tumor H2O2 levels, along with up to 10-fold higher accumulation of MnPs in tumor than in normal tissue73 – as major reactants in a process of S-gluthathionylation – drive higher tumor yield of NF-κB oxidation relative to normal tissue. Consequently, apoptotic processes are favored in the tumor, whereas a suppression of inflammation occurs in normal tissue (Figure 2).66
        Drugs, commonly known as antioxidants/vitamins, such as ascorbate, tocopherols, and carotenoids, have been tested in clinical trials as single anticancer drugs with only marginal effect. The lack of effect is still not fully understood. Batinic-Haberle et al have contributed recently to the understanding of why that maybe so.63,73 In order to affect cancer cell metabolism, the redox active drug needs to inhibit anti-apoptotic pathways. It seems that such inhibition does not happen primarily by removing RS, as thought for a long while, but instead by using RS to oxidize signaling protein cysteines. The major function of ascorbate under physiological conditions is to protect tocopherol; it cycles with oxidized tocopherol radical thereby regenerating tocopherol. Yet at higher levels, achieved if added exogenously, ascorbate cycling with endogenous metal complexes (such as cyt P450 oxidases) will result in a large production of cytotoxic H2O2, which in turn will oxidize and inactivate thiols of critical cellular proteins (such as NF-κB and complexes I and III of mitochondrial respiration). In turn, tumor growth may be moderately suppressed. Yet, a massive anticancer effect could be achieved with increased yield of protein oxidation, when additional source(s) of H2O2 (RT and chemotherapy) and/or catalyst, optimized for ascorbate oxidation (such as MnTE-2-PyP5+ or MnTnBuOE-2PyP5+), are applied (Figure 2).69,72–74
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      This meeting covered large themes of the hypoxia field and highlighted the complexity of the oxygen sensing pathway. It opened discussion about perspectives to better understand its role in physiology and disease occurrence and to specifically target it for therapies.
    
  
        Long non-coding RNAs are involved with development and progression of cancer, and the advance of microarray technology allows the researchers to investigate the complete expression profile of lncRNA in various kinds of sample. We enrolled 5 male primary HCC cases with chronic HBV infection and the HCC and normal tissues have been obtained during the resection surgery. After total RNA extraction, the lncRNA microarray analysis was conducted to determine the lncRNA and mRNA expression signals. 612 lncRNAs and 1,064 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in HCC tissue while 656 lncRNAs and 1,532 mRNAs were down-regulated in HCC tissues. Compared with normal tissues, XLOC_007433 (fold change: 12.80) and AC144449.1 (fold change: 27.20) were the most over- and under-expressed lncRNAs in HCC tissues. As for the mRNA, THBS4 (fold change:41.13) and CXCL14 (fold change: 58.03) were the most over- and under-expressed mRNAs in HCC tissues when comparing with their normal counterparts. In total, 4,552 pairs of lncRNA-mRNA were identified and the co-expression network was constructed. Moreover, the gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the significantly different transcript between HCC and normal tissues were mainly associated with response to wounding, inflammatory response, protein hetrodimerization activity, response to stress which involved with biological process and molecular function. The pathway analysis suggested that the most significant pathways consisted of alcoholism, regulatory RNA pathways and RNA polymerase transcription. Several novel differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified in the present study.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the one of the most fatal among all kinds of cancer, roughly the fatality reached 0.95. The early detection and surgical resection would help to improve the outcome with a 5 year overall survival of 39% approximately [1]. However, most of HCC cases are not discovered and treated until the advanced stage or severe symptoms occurred. Due to the degenerated liver function, distant metastasis, and possible cirrhosis, liver resection is only available for less than 30% of HCC cases [2]. Even if some local therapies of HCC were introduced, including ethanol ablation, radiation therapy, and transcatheter aterial chemoembolization, the 5 year overall survival for HCC cases with any stage is only about 15% [3]. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify the risk factors of HCC and provide scientific evidence for cancer prevention. With decades of efforts, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [4], hepatitis C virus infection [5], excessive consumption of alcohol [6], and aflatoxin exposure [7] were generally acknowledged as the risk factors of HCC. Particular in China, the HBV infection rate is about 7.18% in general population [8], and the high incidence of HCC in China can be attributed to the high infection rate. A large number of chronic HBV patients in China would continue to progress and possibly developed to cirrhosis and even HCC. The high incidence, high fatality and poor outcome combined together placed heave burden to both the patients' family and healthcare system of China.
      Currently, the onset of HCC is thought to be a complicated process involved with multiple factors, including environmental factors, viral infection and genetic susceptibility. Furthermore, the statistics indicated that approximately 3%-8% of chronic HBV cases would progress to HCC eventually [9], which suggested that the mutations on HBV genome [10] and the genetic variation on human genome would alter the HCC risk together. Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in investigating the association between long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profile and the onset of cancer [11]. Advances in RNA sequencing technologies have discovered the existence of non-coding RNAs which comprised the majority of the transcriptome. By definition, lncRNA refers to the large and diverse class of transcribed RNA with a length of more than 200 nucleotides that lacks protein-coding potential [12]. LncRNA has been proved to possess multiple properties, including regulation of gene transcription, chromatin modification, and epigenetic regulation [13]. Growing evidence demonstrated that thousands of lncRNAs with aberrant expression are associated with different kinds of cancer, including HCC [14]. Previous study conducted among three male HCC cases has revealed that 8 lncRNAs were differentially expressed when comparing the HCC tissues with adjacent normal counterparts [15]. Such approach with remarkable findings, however, sample size was relatively small and HBsAg status among the enrolled subjects were not limited, and has failed to address the different expression profile properly. It is generally acknowledged that the HBV-induced HCC involves the integration of HBV fragment and hepatocellular genome, immune response caused chronic and persistent inflammation, which would definitely express different profile when comparing with non-HBV induced HCC. Xiamen ranks the third position in HCC prevalence with 49.57/100,000 [16], according to the cancer statistics released by China National Cancer Center. High chronic HBV infection rate in general population which was 13.79% leads to the high prevalence of HCC [17]. Moreover, comparing with national average level above mentioned, the HBV prevalence in Xiamen population was almost one fold higher. In this study, we attempted to investigate the expression profile on lncRNA among 5 male HBV induced HCC cases by using microarray analysis, thus we can provide scientific evidence for the male individuals with chronic HBV infection which have been identified as the high risk population of HCC.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of 5 HCC cases
        5 male HCC cases with chronic HBV infection undergone liver resection have been enrolled in our study between November 2015 to January 2016. The tissue samples have been acquired during operation in accordance with the procedures stated in materials and methods section. The demographic and clinical characteristics of enrolled 5 subjects were demonstrated in Table 1. As can be seen, the average age was 42.8 years, and the average duration of HBV infection was 12.6 years. The average tumor size was 5.86 cm, and 3 subjects have AFP level higher than 400 ng/ml. As for the liver function parameters, 3 subjects showed elevated AST level, and 4 have higher AST level when comparing with reference range, but only 1 subject showed elevated total bilirubin level.

        Overview of the lncRNA and mRNA expression profile in HCC and normal tissues
        In total, 15,328 lncRNAs and 21,717 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed when comparing the HCC tissues and normal tissues in 5 enrolled subjects. Of these above mentioned RNAs, 612 lncRNAs and 1,064 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated (≥2 fold change and no less than 3 biological replicates) in HCC tissue while 656 lncRNAs and1,532 mRNAs were down-regulated in HCC tissues. Compared with normal tissues, XLOC_007433 (fold change: 12.80) and AC144449.1 (fold change: 27.20) were the most over- and under-expressed lncRNAs in HCC tissues. As for the mRNA, we found that THBS4 (fold change:41.13) and CXCL14 (fold change: 58.03) were the most over- and under-expressed mRNAs in HCC tissues when comparing with their normal counterparts. The scatter plot of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs was demonstrated in Figure 1 and the volcano plot was showed in Figure 2.

        Based on the expression level of all tested RNAs in microarray analysis, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis to group lncRNAs and mRNAs, allowing us to hypothesize the relationship among samples. The denodrogram in Figure 3 demonstrated the relationships of the lncRNA expression profiles between HCC tissues and normal tissue (Figure 3A) and mRNA expression profiles were showed in Figure 3B.

        Classification of differentially expressed LncRNAs
        We further classified the 612 over-expressed lncRNAs and 656 down-regulated lncRNAs in accordance with their different features, including genome location and context, exerted effect on DNA, and functioning and targeting mechanisms. The detailed results were showed in Table 2 and Figure 4. As can be seen, we found that 112 up-regulated and 153 down-regulated sense lncRNAs in the comparison of expression profile between cancerous and normal tissues. As for antisense lncRNAs, 150 were up-regulated and 133 were down-regulated. The profiling data also suggested 103 divergent lncRNAs were up-regulated while 30 were down-regulated. 215 intergenic lncRNAs were over expressed and 268 were under expressed. Furthermore, we identified 32 up-regulated intronic lncRNAs and 72 down-regulated, respectively.

        Construction of lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network
        In order to investigate the correlation between differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA, the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed based on the correlation analysis and only those gene pairs with an absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficients not less than 0.99 were included. In total, 4,552 pairs of lncRNA-mRNA were identified in accordance with above mentioned criteria. We further selected the top 1000 among all significant correlations to draw the co-expression network (See Figure 5). The network suggested that one mRNA can be correlated with several lncRNAs and vice versa, however, we did not observe significant cluster by visual inspection. In particular, the most over-express lncRNA XLOC_007433 were positively correlated with the expression of HLA-DQB1, CFD, MSR1, LPAR5, GRAP2 and MBNL2, while inversely associated with MAP3K13 and MBNL2. The correlation analysis found no mRNA was correlated with the most under-expressed lncRNA AC144449.1. The most up-regulated coding gene THBS4 was correlated with 2 lncRNAs, namely uc.77- and ENSG00000249042.1. As for the CXCL14 which has been identified as the most down-regulated gene, only ENSG00000232593.2 was inversely correlated with the expression of it.

        Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis results
        GO analysis was conducted among all differentially expressed mRNAs to identify the function of coding transcripts. Through the analysis we revealed that the significantly different transcript between HCC and normal tissues were mainly associated response to wounding (GO:0009611), inflammatory response (GO:0006954), protein hetrodimerization activity (GO:0046982), response to stress (GO:0006950) which involved with biological process and molecular function, and the detailed results were presented in Figure 6. Moreover, we found that cellular process (GO: biological process), localization (GO: biological process), extracellular matrix (GO: cellular component), and extracellular region complex (GO: cellular component) were the most enriched terms (See Figure 7). The pathway analysis suggested that the most significant pathways consisted of alcoholism (hsa05034), regulatory RNA pathways (REACT_12472) and RNA polymerase transcription (REACT_1309) and the detailed result of pathway analysis was showed in Figure 8.

      DISCUSSION
      As reported by the previous studies, the incidence of HCC in male population was about 3 times higher when comparing with female counterparts in global range [18]. The gender difference in HCC incidence could partly attribute to the higher prevalence of excessive alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking in men. But more importantly, male population is prone to infect with HBV or HCV by sexual transmission or blood transmission, therefore, combined these evidences together, male individuals aged 45-65 have been identified as the high risk population of HCC. Given the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in China, especially in the male population without the protection of universal HBV vaccination program, it is of great importance to investigate the underlying genetic mechanism of HCC among this high risk population. To achieve that, we enrolled 5 male HCC cases with chronic HBV infection and performed the lncRNA microarray analysis in cancerous and normal tissue and bioinformatics were conducted to analyze the data.
      Chronic HBV infection would possibly lead to the onset of HCC, and the underlying mechanism of it is different from those caused by other carcinogens, for instance, aflatoxin and alcohol. The major feature of HBV infection is the integration into host genome, and the integration can both be found in HCC tissue [19] and non-tumor tissue [20] from chronic HBV-infected patients. The random integration event has been acknowledged as the risk factor of developing HCC, because it is capable of disrupting cellular gene expression which is important for cellular growth and differentiation. A study revealed that the gene disruption, viral promoter-driven human transcription, DNA fusion and copy number alteration near the integration sites [21], indicating that the gene expression can be altered by HBV infection and consequently elevating the HCC risk. In our present study, we identified that 1,676 lncRNAs and 2,596 mRNAs were differentially expressed when comparing the HCC tissues with the normal counterparts. Unlike gene coding RNAs, lncRNAs are generally expressed in very low level, and the expression prolife of lncRNA in cancer development is specific [22]. Considering the large number of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs we identified in our samples, we can assume that the HBV-induced carcinogenesis is involved with the altered expression of various kinds of lncRNA and mRNA.
      Surprisingly, both the most over and under expressed lncRNAs have not yet been associated with any cancer in reviewing previous researches, however, we did observe the positive correlation between XLOC_007433 which is the most over-expressed in HCC tissues and HLA-DQB1.It is generally acknowledged that human leukocyte antigens (HLA) involved with defending viral infection and carcinogenesis. Our study examined the mRNA expression signal and found that the HLA-DQB1 was significantly lower in HCC tissue. Although the HLA-DQB1 has been found to be associated with some cancers, however, the precise role of it has not yet been identified, a recent meta-analysis suggested that the variations occurred in HLA-DQB1 were related with the risk of HCC after pooling all available data [23]. These findings could partly support our assumption that among the chronic HBV carriers with compromised immunity, the chance of developing HCC is higher.
      As for the gene coding RNAs, one unanticipated finding was that THBS4 is the most up-regulated gene in HCC tissues. Generally speaking, THBS4 belongs to the thrombospondin protein family which involved in diverse biologic processes given their potential to bind numerous proteins and serve as interaction platforms in the extracellular matrix [24]. The elevation of THBS4 expression in HCC tissue was firstly reported according to our data, however, its expression has been associated with the invasion of breast cancer previously, and the evidence suggested that elevated THBS4 expression contributes to the activated stromal response exhibited during tumor progression and this may facilitate invasion of tumor cells [25]. Although no previous publication supports the role of THBS4 in HCC development, it is worth to investigate the underlying mechanism between THBS4 and HCC, for the expression of THBS4can be up-regulated in tissue injury, remodeling, immune response and inflammation. CXCL14 is a novel chemokine, and mainly stimulating cell migration that involved with immune surveillance, inflammation and cancer [26]. Our finding is consistent with the results of an animal experiment which suggested that CXCL14 was significantly suppressed in HCC tissues of mice in vivo, moreover, CXCL14 has been proved to be a tumor suppressor and capable of inducing tumor cell apoptosis through both the mitochondrial and nuclear apoptosis pathway [27]. A case-control study involved with 361 HBV-related HCC cases and 407 healthy controls also supports our finding, it has been revealed that the polymorphism in CXCL14 was associated with the HCC progression, suggesting that CXCL14 might alter the disease development by inhibiting tumor growth [28]. Hence it could conceivably be hypothesized that CXCL14 could be an important tumor suppressor in HBV-related HCC, and investigation on the underlying mechanism should be conducted.
      GO and pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed mRNAs are mainly involved with wounding, inflammatory response, protein hetrodimerization activity and response to stress. The results may be explained by the fact that viral protein generates inflammatory environment within the liver, and reactive oxygen species resulting oxidative stress causes widespread hepatic cell damage [29]. This also accords with our earlier observations, which showed that the alteration of global Th1/Th2-like cytokine expression was observed in metastatic HCC tissues when comparing with non- metastatic tissues, suggesting that inflammatory response is capable of promoting HCC metastasis [30].
      Overall, we investigated the lncRNA and mRNA expression profile which are related to the onset of HCC in male chronic HBV subjects, and several novel differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified by using microarray analysis. Further research is necessary to reveal the molecular mechanism and biological function of lcnRNAs in HBV-related HCC.
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Sample collection and RNA extraction
        This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University. All subjects enrolled were physically signed the written consent before sample collection. Samples were acquired from 5 eligible HCC cases following these criteria: (1) pathologically diagnosed with primary HCC (ICD9-155); (2) male; (3) chronic HBV infection confirmed by ELISA prior to the onset of HCC; (4)permanent residents who lived in Xiamen over 10 years and aging from 20 to 79 years. Patients were excluded if any of the following conditions were met:(1) liver disease due to parasitosis, diabetes, fatty liver, metabolism disorders or severe cardiovascular diseases; (2) presence of cancers other than HCC; (3) autoimmune hepatitis or toxic hepatitis; (4) refuse to participate. Tissues acquired from 5 eligible HCC cases were divided into following two groups: primary HCC tissues (CA) and normal tissue distant from tumor edge for 5cm (NT). In total, 10 tissue samples were acquired during the liver resection and placed in liquid nitrogen pre-freezing RNase-free vial for 5 min, and stored at −78°C prior to RNA extraction. Tissue samples were subjected to RNA extraction using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, MA, USA). The purity and concentration of RNA were measured from OD260/280 readings using a NanoDrop ND-1000, and the integrity was assessed using standard denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Only RNA extracts with total volume higher than 8μg undergone further analysis.
      
      
        Microarray analysis
        The paired cancer and normal samples used to synthesize double stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), and the cDNA product was labeled and hybridized to lncRNA + mRNA Human Gene Expression Microarray V4.0 (CaptialBio Corp, Beijing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The microarray we used contains 40,916 human lncRNAs probes and 34,235 mRNA probes, and 4,974 Agilent control probes. Each RNA was detected by corresponding probes repeated for two times.
      
      
        Microarray imaging and data analysis
        The data generated from lncRNA + mRNA microarray was analyzed for data summarization, normalization and quality control by using GeneSpring software version 12.0 (Agilent, CA, USA). In order to identify the differentially expressed genes, we employed threshold values of ≥2 fold change and a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P value of ≤0.05. The data was log 2 transformed and median centered by genes using Adjust Data function of Multiexperiment Viewer software (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, MA, USA). Further analysis, such as hierarchical clustering with average linkages was performed. Treeview software (Stanford University, CA, USA) composed by Java was employed to visualize the microarray results.
      
      
        Correlation analysis between lncRNA and mRNA
        The network between lncRNA and mRNA was constructed based on the correlation analysis among differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA. For each pair of genes, a Pearson correlation was estimated and the pairs with an absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficients not less than 0.99 were selected to draw the network by using Cytoscape. In network analysis, yellow node represents the lncRNA and green node represents the mRNA. Red lines indicate a positive correlation, and blue lines indicate an inverse correlation.
      
      
        GO and pathway analysis
        GO analysis provides three structured networks of defined terms that describe gene product properties, including biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Differentially expressed mRNAs between HCC tissue and normal tissue were included in GO term enrichment and pathway analysis based on the latest KEGG database. This analysis enabled us to identify the biological pathways for differentially expressed mRNAs in acquired samples.
      
    
  
        The dependence of cancer on overexpressed c-MYC and its predisposition for polyploidy represents a double puzzle. We address this conundrum by cross-species transcription analysis of c-MYC interacting genes in polyploid vs. diploid tissues and cells, including human vs. mouse heart, mouse vs. human liver and purified 4n vs. 2n mouse decidua cells. Gene-by-gene transcriptome comparison and principal component analysis indicated that c-MYC interactants are significantly overrepresented among ploidy-associated genes. Protein interaction networks and gene module analysis revealed that the most upregulated genes relate to growth, stress response, proliferation, stemness and unicellularity, as well as to the pathways of cancer supported by MAPK and RAS coordinated pathways. A surprising feature was the up-regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) modules embodied by the N-cadherin pathway and EMT regulators from SNAIL and TWIST families. Metabolic pathway analysis also revealed the EMT-linked features, such as global proteome remodeling, oxidative stress, DNA repair and Warburg-like energy metabolism. Genes associated with apoptosis, immunity, energy demand and tumour suppression were mostly down-regulated. Noteworthy, despite the association between polyploidy and ample features of cancer, polyploidy does not trigger it. Possibly it occurs because normal polyploidy does not go that far in embryonalisation and linked genome destabilisation. In general, the analysis of polyploid transcriptome explained the evolutionary relation of c-MYC and polyploidy to cancer.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      c-MYC is a potent, highly conserved transcription factor that interacts with at least several thousands of genes [1]. c-MYC can be considered as a pleiotropic sensor, integrating multiple cellular signals and mediating a transcriptional response that drives cell stress, growth/proliferation, and apoptosis. Activation of c-MYC transcription is an end-point for a broad range of signal-transduction pathways [2]. A link between c-MYC and initiation and maintenance of a wide range of neoplasms is well documented (for reviews, see [3–6]). However, c-MYC (and other members of its family) is rarely mutated in cancers but is activated by gene amplification or translocation, and the resulting abundance of c-MYC activity leads to cellular immortality associated with blockade of differentiation [2, 3]. c-MYC was discovered to act in synergy with another powerful oncogene, mutated (and constitutively active) RAS as a complementary pair in experimental murine tumors [7]. A tumor may critically depend on the activated c-MYC so that switching it off, as shown in transgenic mouse models, causes tumour regression. This phenomenon has been termed “oncogene addiction” [8]. c-MYC is also one of the Yamanaka factors used for induction of pluripotency in somatic cells (iPSC) [9].
      In addition to having a large number of direct transcriptional targets, c-MYC is also a global amplifier of transcription [10] due to a wide range of secondary targets, resulting in a global increase in absolute cellular abundance of mRNAs [11]. It also causes chromatin remodeling to promote the more open conformation [8]. Importanly, overexpressed c-MYC causes endopolyploidy by decoupling DNA synthesis and mitosis [12].
      Although somatic polyploidy (endopolyploidy) is normally encountered in a few normal mammalian tissues (liver, brain, vascular smooth muscle cells, heart, megakaryocytes, and placenta) [13–19], most solid tumours of any origin develop polyploidy and aneuploidy correlating with poor prognosis [20–27]. The tight association of malignancy with aneuploidy is a surprising fact in view of its essentially anti-proliferative effect [28–31]. Polyploidy came recently into the focus of cancer research because it can be induced in malignant cells (mostly with mutated TP53) by genotoxic agents. The reversed (de-polyploidised within one-three weeks) cells can serve as the origin of clonogenic recovery and resistance to anti-tumor drugs [14, 20, 25, 32, 33].
      Because of this intricate relationship between c-MYC, polyploidy and neoplasia, we analysed the c-MYC interacting genes in normal polyploid cells to seek an answer for these two questions: (1) which properties of c-MYC that confer normal polyploidy may explain its function in promoting cancer and resistance to anticancer agents? (2) why normal polyploid cells are not tumorous and how they maintain normalcy? To this end, we analysed c-MYC-interacted genes associated with polyploidy from the available complete transcriptomes of liver, heart and placenta in mouse and human.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Polyploidy induces c-MYC interacting genes in heart, liver and placenta
        To expose the evolutionary conserved ploidy-related functions among MYC-interacting genes, we compared the MYC interactomes (protein-protein interactions) in heart, liver and decidua cells. We took advantage of the patterns of pairwise reciprocal polyploid versus diploid organ comparison: human heart vs. mouse heart and mouse liver vs. human liver. The average nuclear ploidy in human liver is 2.05±0.008 n, whereas in mouse liver it is 5.47±0.1 n, and the average nuclear ploidy in mouse heart is 2.05±0.007 n, whereas in human heart it is 4.04±0.05n [34, 35]. Thus, human hepatocytes and mouse cardiomyocytes have predominantly diploid nuclei, whereas human cardiomyocytes and mouse hepatocytes have predominantly polyploid nuclei. Other authors also showed the higher ploidy level of mouse hepatocytes compared to human hepatocytes [36, 37, 38] and human cardiomyocytes compared to mouse cardiomyocytes [39, 40]. This reciprocal comparison across tissues and species removes species and tissue-specific signals and thus reveals evolutionary conserved ploidy-specific effects on gene expression (see also MATERIAL & METHODS).
        The analysis was performed with three gene sets (as detailed in MATERIAL & METHODS): (1) the genes with common ploidy-associated change of expression in polyploid vs. diploid heart and liver and in tetraploid vs. diploid early mouse decidua cells (i.e. for three pair-wise comparisons); (2) the genes with similar direction of changes between polyploid vs. diploid heart and liver (i.e. for two pair-wise comparisons); (3) the genes with differential expression in tetraploid vs. diploid early mouse decidua cells (for one pair-wise comparison). Here we applied gene-by-gene and module-by-module comparisons. For better understanding of the functional relationships between genes, we constructed for these differentially expressed genes the corresponding protein interaction networks using the String database [1]. Finally, we verified the data on heart and liver obtained by NGS using the data obtained by microarrays [41].
        We obtained three ploidy-associated gene lists containing 200 genes with increased and 76 genes with decreased expression for polyploidy versus diploidy in heart, liver and placenta (Supplementary Table S1). The corresponding numbers are 467 and 186 for ploidy-associated genes if only heart and liver are considered (Supplementary Table S2), and 1401 and 727 gens for the comparison in the 4n vs 2n early mouse decidua cells (Supplementary Table S3). The lists of biological modules significantly enriched for ploidy-associated genes with regard to the entire genome (13327 genes) and simultaneously to all known c-MYC interactants with known orthologs in human and mouse (3734) are presented in Supplementary Tables S4–S6. Although we focus only on the common heart, liver and placenta traits, we present here the gene and module lists for three gene sets. As can be seen from the Supplementary Tables S4–S6, the majority of polyploidy-upregulated genes in all three tissues belong to the modules related to growth, stress response, proliferation and stemness, including WNT, Pi3K, Hippo, Hedgehog, FGF, FOXM and TGF-beta (Supplementary Tables S4–S6) as well as protooncogenes that are supported by the MAPK system and belong to the Ras-coordinated gene module. This finding suggests a link between polyploidy and activation of fetal program and is in good agreement with the experimental data obtained with somatic cells reporting the ploidy regulation by Hippo signaling [42–44]. The most surprising common ploidy-associated feature of all three gene lists was the manifestation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, we found features of fetal phenotype within the corresponding metabolic configuration, including the Warburg's effect.
        Table 1 reports the genes with the strongest ploidy–associated regulation shared by the three data bases. It is evident that ploidy-associated genes include well-recognized major EMT regulators like SNAIL, BMP, N-cadherin as well as EMT metabolic marker stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) [45]. The distribution of EMT-related genes among various functional groups associated with development (BMP2, SNAI2, BMP7), extracellular matrix and adhesion (CDH2, FN1; MMP14), metabolism (SCD) and sress response (EPAS1) as well as good gene concordance for different data bases suggests that EMT – is a polyploidy inherent feature. Some genes related to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) are also upregulated, including HGF, WNT2B and FGFR1 (Table 1) and a few epithelial markers (Supplementary Table S1–S3) were revealed, as well.

        c-MYC and nucleostemin (GNL3L) demonstrate gene dosage exceeding induction in rodent tetraploid vs diploid hepatocytes
        Cross-species and cross-tissue analysis of the c-MYC interacting genes revealed a higher c-MYC expression per genome in polyploid compared to diploid tissues and cells (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1). In particular, we found manifestation of stemness and induction of well-established stem-cell marker and direct target of c-MYC nucleostemin (GNL3L), which is normally not expressed in adult tissues [46, 47]. To confirm this finding, we carried out an immunocytochemical study of c-MYC and GNL3 protein content in polyploid vs. diploid hepatocytes of adult mice. We found that for both c-MYC and GNL3L protein content per genome is significantly higher in tetraploid cell nuclei than in diploid ones (in other words, it is higher than a gene dose). Interestingly, in octaploid nuclei the increased protein content per genome was not further elevated (Figure 1A, 1B). Similar results were obtained with adult rat livers (not shown). The characteristic elongated nuclei of Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) seen among hepatocytes served us as internal negative control for both proteins. Expression of c-MYC and GLN3L was confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 1C). Our results suggest that cross-species data can be used to infer the intra-species relationships and that transition from diploidy to tetraploidy confers the cells the new properies linked to stemness and proliferative potential, which are not simply the result of increased gene dosage indicating to the change in transcription profile.

            A. Mouse hepatocytes were fixed and stained for c-Myc and nucleostemin (GNL3L) in combination with DAPI; B. Immunofluorescence image cytometry analysis showed that c-Myc and GNL3L protein content per genome is significantly higher in tetraploid cell nuclei as compared with diploid and C. RT-PCR performed with two different primer pairs, confirms expression of c-Myc and GLN3: 35, 40: PCR cycles number.
          
          
        
      
      
        Principal component analysis (PCA) identifies ploidy-associated conserved features: the significance of c-MYC
        The main effects of c-MYC transcriptional regulatory activity are promotion of cell proliferation, embryonal programs, carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis [48, 49]. An important direct effect of c-MYC overexpression is the disconnection of DNA synthesis from mitosis, which results in polyploidy [12].
        We next provide evidence for a potential function of c-MYC in polyploidy using a purely data-driven a posteriori approach. This strategy is based on the finding of enrichment of c-MYC interactants among the genes with significant scores (> 2SD) in the principal component axis related to ploidy. In addition to confirming of c-MYC involvement in ploidy, the approach gives global metabolic characterization of ploidy. Table 2 presents the loading pattern and the percentage of explained variability of the principal components of the heart-liver data set. PCA shows a clear hierarchical order of relevance in terms of explained variation and consequently of the associated biological factor:

        PC1 (45.6% of total variance) corresponds to Shared Variability: more-to-less expressed genes independent of species, tissue and ploidy (all the variables enter PC1 with loadings of the same sign). This component probably reflects the ‘house-keeping’ gene fraction, which can be considered a ‘size’ component [50].
        PC2 (30.5% of total variance): corresponds to Tissue-Effect: heart and liver samples enter the component with opposite loadings; PC2 is thus a ‘shape’ component [50] linked to the differential profiles of the two tissues. High values of component scores point to genes with higher expression in the heart than in the liver, while the opposite holds for low component scores (note that the loadings correspond to the correlation coefficients between variables and components).
        PC3 (15% of total variance): corresponds to Species-Effect: mouse and human samples enter PC2 with opposite loadings irrespective of the tissue type. High values of component scores correspond to genes whose level of expression is higher in mice than in humans, while the opposite holds for low values of components.
        PC4 (9% of total variance): corresponds to Ploidy-Effect: polyploid samples (HS heart and MM liver variables) have negative loadings on PC4 while diploid samples (MM heart and HS liver) show positive loadings. This implies that high component scores correspond to genes whose expression is suppressed by polyploidy condition, while low component scores correspond to genes whose expression level is increased by polyploidy as such.
        It is worth noting that the fourth component could in principle only represent the ‘noise’ component given we have an initially four dimension space. So we checked for the non-gaussian (and consequently non-noisy) character of PC4. The signal character of PC4 was confirmed by its huge Kurtosis value (502.04 to be compared to the value of 3 typical of normal distribution) pointing to the fact the by far the major portion of PC4 variance was accounted for few outlier genes. The soundness of 2SD threshold was confirmed by the fact the 99% percentile of PC4 distribution (that has by construction 0-mean and unit standard deviation) is at 1.38SD (another proof of concept of its non-gaussian character).
        The result shows that polyploidy does not exert dramatic effect on transcriptome and accounts for only about 10% of variability in the human vs. mouse heart as well as in the mouse vs. human liver. PCA results are in agreement with generally accepted notion that the effects of polyploidy are weak and unique because of gene dosage compensation for the majority of genes [51]. At the same time, PCA revealed a minor albeit significant pure ‘polyploidy-related’ component independent of both species and tissue–linked effects.
        Notably, we extracted four components starting by an initially four-dimensional system; this implies that we applied PCA as a pure geometrical transformation corresponding to the rotation of the initial data set into a basis set spanned by mutually orthogonal axes (components) with no loss of information. The hierarchical character of component extraction (the components are numbered in decreasing order of variance explained) reflects the relative importance of shared (house-keeping genes), tissue, species and ploidy effects. The expression value of each gene can be comprised as a summation over the four components. Given that each component has by construction zero mean and unit standard deviation over the whole set of genes we can consider the genes having a PC4 score exceeding 2 SD (in a module) as the genes exceeding the 95% confidence interval with respect to PC4 and thus, ‘significantly’ contributing to the PC4 ploidy component [52]. To investigate whether PCA revealed ploidy associated genes (we considered genes having a score > 2 SD in a module) are enriched for c-MYC interactome, we extracted c-MYC interactants from the String database [1]. After that, we matched them to all 13327 human-mouse orthologous genes. Overall, we obtained 3327 genes, which make up a proportion of 0.24 of all orthologous genes. Using binomial test for comparison of this proportion to the proportions of c-MYC interactants among significantly ploidy-induced genes, 0.408 (55 of 134), and ploidy-inhibited genes, 0.5010 (50 of 98) (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8) show a p-value < 0.000005 for the difference between 0.24 and 0.408 and p< 0.0000001, for the difference between 0.24 and 0.501, respectively.
        Figures 2A and 2B present the MYC-interacting gene distribution in PC1 of PCA space, with the 2 and 3 Standard Deviations lines on PC4 shown. The strong coherence between two completely different statistical paradigms of selection (PCA does not explicitly encompass ploidy in the algorithm being only based on the between profiles mutual correlations) offers a proof-of-concept of the robustness of the obtained results. This coherence allows us further sketch the functional description of c-MYC interactants. We base our analysis on values of genes scoring in PC4 higher than three SDs together with the major known ploidy-regulator genes with a lower than 2 SD PC4 scores.
        
          Figure 2
          
            PCA revealed ploidy-associated genes in c-Myc interactome of heart-liver A. and placenta B. Genes demonstrating the most pronounced variation with ploidy are indicated by enlarged symbols
            Symbol colours represent gene functions as listed in legend. In both, heart-liver (A) and in placenta (B) polyploidy is associated with the induction of developmental markers and genes related to protein synthesis, oxidative stress response and sugar metabolism. Genes related to aerobic respiration are mainly repressed. Purple lines mark 2SD and 3SD.
          
          
        
        In this way, we found that C-MYC interacting genes with substantial ploidy variation participate in cytoskeleton maintenance, growth, ATP reservation, energy metabolism and oxidative stress protection (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table S7). GO categories and KEGG pathways enriched in ploidy-associated genes with more than 2 SD expression difference between polyploid/diploid organs and cells (Supplementary Table S8) relate to oxidative and xenobiotic stress response, protein synthesis and processes related to single cell organisms.
        To identify ‘ploidy-related’ effect on gene expression in purified diploid and tetraploid mouse decidua cells, we applied the same geometrical approach.
        In this case, we have a bidimensional initial data set corresponding to two expression vectors of diploid and tetraploid cells (See Supplementary Table S9). The complete PCA solution gives rise to a two components space spanned by a pre-dominant shared variation axis (size component, correspondent to the cell developmental differentiation attractor state) in which diploid and polyploid tissues are loaded with the same sign and a minor ‘ploidy’ component encompassing the divergent expressions between the two conditions (the two vectors enter with opposite loading). Table 3 shows the correspondent loading pattern:

        As expected, PC1 explains the major part of variability (96.3%), it shows the existence of a very strong and invariant ‘tissue attractor’ correspondent to the specific placental expression profile (see for example [53]), while ploidy related PC2 accounts for a minor portion of expression variation (3.7%).
        Nevertheless, such minor variation allows for the identification of some relevant genes: in Supplementary Table S9 the ‘relevant’ gene expressions (higher than 2 or lower than −2 SD units) introduce in function-related evidence. Consistently with the loading signs, (see Supplementary Table S9) positive values of the component correspond to genes whose expression is higher in diploid state, while negative values correspond to genes whose expression is higher for polyploid tissues. Figure 2B presents this situation. X- axis corresponds to the PC1 shared variation and Y axis to ploidy factor, two lines are set at the 2 SD thresholds.
        To examine whether c-MYC interactants are significantly over-represented among the genes of decidua cells revealed by PCA as tetraploidy related, we matched them to all 22020 genes of this set. The obtained 3845 genes comprised 0.19 of all genes. Then, like for heart and liver, we compared this proportion to the proportions of c-MYC interactants among significantly ploidy-induced genes 0.348 (152 of 436) and ploidy-inhibited genes 0.292 (242 of 828) using binomial test. The results show a near zero p-value (p<10−24) for the difference between 0.19 and 0.348 and a p-value = 7.79821E-13 for the difference between 0.19 and 0.29.
        To present briefly the ploidy-related effects revealed by PCA in early mouse decidua, we describe the up- and down-regulated c-MYC interactants with the most prominent expression difference between diploid and tetraploid cells. We also specified the most important biological regulators demonstrating significant variation with ploidy. Gene function description is in Supplementary Table S9. Finally, Figure 3 shows the MYC-interacting gene distribution in PC1-PC4 space for polyploidy effects of three tissues with lines indicating 2 and 3 Standard Deviations on PC4. We also provide below a brief functional description of the c-MYC interactants displaying more than 3 SD and several principal biological regulators with lower than 3 SD but significant ploidy-regulation.

Bars with no squares have q-value not less than 0.15 with regard to all Myc targets and not less than 0.05 with regard to all orthologs. Module groups confirmed by gene-by-gene analysis are marked with brown diamonds.
          
          
        
        The analysis of biological modules enriched in ploidy-associated genes in heart, liver and in decidua cells using PCA (Figure 3) indicates that polyploidy activates a response to oxidative stress, DNA repair, and modules related to cancer, thus suggesting that genome duplication enhances oncogenic proclivity. As well, we found clear manifestations of the fetal program significant for cancer [54] including the induction of modules related to single cell organisms, protein synthesis and modules regulating sugar and lipid metabolism. In accordance with oncogenic and fetal traits, modules of apoptosis and immunity are inhibited (Figure 3). Modules of transport show the downregulation of cytomembrane transport and upregulation of vesicular transport. This modification is in agreement with ploidy related decrease of cell surface to volume ratio and with its compensation by active vesicular transport [21–23]. Importantly, practically all changes revealed by the PCA module groups are in a good agreement with gene cross-species comparison. These modules are marked in Figure 3 with brown diamonds.
        In summary, PCA of gene expression profiles in heart-liver and 4n/2n decidua cells revealed the following biological features of gene expression programs associated with polyploidy: response to oxidative and xenobiotic stress, embryonality, apoptosis impairment, the shift to anaerobic and ATP saving type of energy production, and induction of modules related to single cell organisms.
      
      
        Ploidy associated protein interaction networks reveal synergetic activation of regulome, embryonic features, and stress response
        Modules and protein interaction networks can offer a link between genes and biological functions, thus consitute a key step in connecting genotype and phenotype [55]. Therefore, we next constructed protein interaction networks encoded by the genes positively and negatively related with polyploidy with a high stringency for interaction (>0.9). Such 'ploidy induced' network containing clusters of c-MYC, p53, cell cycle, WNT, HRAS, IGF signaling, nucleoli and extracellular matrix is presented in Figure 4A. The protein network of 'ploidy-repressed' genes presented in Figure 4B contains clusters of inflammation, lipid metabolism, tumor suppression, and apoptosis. As can be readily seen, the induced network contains more transcription factors, multifunctional regulators and growth factors (E2f 4, 5, 7, 8, SNAI1, 2, TWIST1, HRAS, c-KIT, c-MYC, GATA2, TP53; WNT6, 2B, 9B, BMP2, 7, IGF1, EGF, EGFR, HGF, FGFR1) than the ploidy-inhibited network (RB1, PAK1, PAK2, PAK7, MEF2a, c, APAF1). Accordingly, GO biological processes and KEGG pathways in the polyploidy-induced network are related to cancer, metabolism, cell cycle, stem cell pathways (Pi3K, Hippo, Hedgehog, WNT), EMT and MET pathways and stress response (Figure 4A), while again, the pathways of apoptosis, cell death, inflammation and cytoskeleton with Rho signaling elements are inhibited (Figure 4B). To find out whether the association between polyploidy and c-MYC is reciprocal, we also analysed the types of molecular interactions for the networks depicted at Figure 4A and 4B using server String. Our data indicate that polyploidy influences several genes targeting c-MYC via direct binding (Figure 4A and 4B). The ploidy-activated genes include c-MYC inducer YY1 [56], oncogene MYB [57], and E2F4 which retards c-MYC increased proliferation via negative feedback loop in the mitotic restriction (R) point [58]. The genes inhibited by ploidy are also presented by c-MYC suppressors RB1 [59] and PAK2 [60, 61]. At the same time, it is established that c-MYC overexpression uncouples DNA replication from mitosis completion causing polyploidy as such [12, 62, 63] and our study of cell cycle regulating genes confirmed it (see below). The causal relationship between the overexpressed c-MYC and normal polyploidy was clearly confirmed in mouse hepatocytes where overexpressed or underexpressed c-MYC correspondingly accelerated or retarded developmental polyploidization [64, 65]. So, in general the data suggests that the programmed overexpression of c-MYC causing developmental polyploidy is also under some feedback control by it.

        Cell cycle regulation reveals polyploidy-associated proliferation potential
        Polyploid hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes were reported arising via aborted (polyploidising) mitoses (reaching ploidies 4-8C, rarer 16-32C) [17, 37, 66]. Our data are fully in agreement with these observations (Figures 4A, 5, 6 and Supplementary Table S4–S6). They reveal features of G1-S induction (Cyclines A1, E1, D3, CDK2, 8, MCM8, TK1, POLA1, PARP1, REV3), metaphase entry (AURKA1 activation), polyploidization (E2F7, 8), and cytokinesis omission (inhibited Rho signalling and cytoskeleton elements ARHGEF28 and ARHGEF7, CDC42EP1, MTM1, MYO5A, MYO3B) coupled to senescence suppression (inhibited PAK1, 2, 7). Thus, we confirm that normal polyploid cells originated by aborted cytokinesis represent in fact a reservoir for cell division and growth [17, 66].

This chart indicates that polyploidy is linked with metabolism activation and modification. This chart demonstrates common nature of ploidy-related stemness and the induction of epithelial-to -mesenchymal transition. The stemness is seen from the upregulation of modules related to stem cell and signaling by PI3K, NOTCH, HIPPO, FGF, FOXO/FOXM WNT, TGF-beta, c-MYC, Hedgehog. Activated epithelial-to -mesenchymal transition is evident from the activated EMT module.
          
          
        
      
      
        c-MYC activation of the ancient Wnt and TGF-beta pathways is associated with the EMT-featured properties of polyploidy
        Our data in all three gene lists show a clear transcriptional activation of GO modules related to Wnt pathways playing a prominent role in controlling cell fate decisions during embryonic development (Supplementary Tables S4–S6, Figures 4A, 7, 8). As well, the genes involved in Wnt pathways regulation were clearly ploidy-upregulated and form a tight subnetwork (Figure 4A). In concordance, we identified the induction of WNT cross-regulated pathways related to transformation (IGF, mTOR, HGF, RAS, E2F (Figures 7, 8) and stemmness (the pathways related to pluripotency, stem cell biology, and Hedgehog, NOTCH, PI3K, FGF, Hippo and TGF- pathways) (Figure 7, Supplementary Tables S4–S6).

This chart shows the increased activity of principal regulators related to selfrenewal (A) and EMT (B) increasing ploidy proclivity for transformation.
          
          
        
        Our observation of an increased activity of WNT-TGF beta signaling is in a good agreement with the general activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2, VCL, TGFA, FN1 (Fibronectin) and CDH2 (N-Cadherin) (Figures 4A, 8, Table 1, Supplementary Tables S1–S3).
        All these facts suggest that c-MYC-related activation of the WNT/TGF beta pathways is a key component of the ploidy-associated network with the tumour-like properties including stemness and EMT. At the same time, coordinated induction of EMT– related genes is coexisting in all three gene lists with a few genes participating in MET that reverse EMT and with some epithethelial markers (Supplementary Tables S1–S3).
      
      
        c-MYC-associated common metabolic profiles of polyploid cells from heart, liver and placenta
        Ploidy-related changes in macromolecule metabolism show enhanced transcription activity, ribogenesis, highly dynamic protein turnover, global proteome remodeling and activated lipid metabolism.
        The metabolic genes and gene modules demonstrating similar ploidy-associated changes in heart, liver and early mouse decidua are presented in Supplementary Tables S1–S6 and in Figure 9. The main functions of the upregulated gene modules are positive regulation of protein metabolic process related to protein transport and phosphorylation. These findings suggest that the proteomic landscape of polyploid cells is very active and differs from that of diploid cells. The upregulation of the phosphate- and phosphorus-related metabolic modules, which are also involved in protein modification and/or cellular signaling regulation, is in agreement with the notion of a global and dynamic proteome remodeling of polyploid cells (Supplementary Tables S3–S5).

Designations for X, Y, figures at the bottom of the bars, red and white arrows pointing to the tips of the bars, bars with no arrows and red diamonds are the same as for Figure 5. This chart indicates that polyploidy is linked to metabolism activation and modification. Specifically, it outlines the boosting of various branches of protein metabolism and transport, induction of sugar metabolism and insulin signaling and the switch of the lipid metabolism from biosynthesis to decomposition. This switch is seen from impaired modules of lipid binding and storage and induced modules related to phospholipase, Acyl-CoA metabolism and PPAR gamma modules. B.

This chart shows the increased activity of sugar and protein metabolism inherent for increased activity of growth processes.
          
          
        
        This highly dynamic proteomic profile implies both protein degradation and synthesis. Therefore, our data highlights a specific upregulation of genes involved in the lysosomal and proteasomal protein degradation (Supplementary Tables S1–S6) and the upregulation of mTOR pathway (Figure 5, Supplementary Tables S4–S6) that enhances translation efficiency and ribosomal biogenesis [67].
        In addition, a switch of lipid metabolism from biosynthesis to decomposition was revealed from impaired modules of lipid binding and storage and induced modules related to phospholipase, Acyl-CoA metabolism, and PPAR gamma modules. This result is in agreement with the recent data by Edmunds and colleagues [68] evidencing increase of fatty acid utilization by c-MYC activation.
        All this shows the highly dynamic features of polyploid cells showing enhanced transcription, ribogenesis, protein turnover, and lipid metabolism.
        Stress response: DNA synthesis and repair machinery, cellular detoxification, protection against oxidative stress and protein glycosylation
        Our data indicate that polyploidy is associated with adaptation to stress. This is evident from the activated pathways crosstalk and general transcriptome elevation (Supplementary Tables S1–S6; Figures 10, 11). The increase of the genome dynamic is seen from the prevalence of induced genes and gene modules over inhibited ones (Supplementary Tables S1–S6; Figures 10, 11) and from a larger (having larger number of connected genes) protein-protein interaction network for the induced genes than for the inhibited ones (Figure 4). Notably, in accordance with the transcriptome activation, all clusters presented in the network on Figure 4 are by 40-90% composed of the genes implicated in stress response (besides their basic functions). Among various stress-related branches, the highest significance of induction (confirmed by PCA) is exposed by the genes involved in DNA repair, oxidative stress and cancer (Figures 3, 10, 11).

This chart demonstrates coordinated induction of module groups related to stress, DNA repair and transformation (cancer-related module group and module groups of c-Myc, RAS and MAPK) and the down-regulation of module groups related to apoptosis and immunity.

This chart demonstrates a combination of induced stress response and suppressed apoptosis and immunity that may increase the risk of cell transformation.
          
          
        
        Other upregulated genes are involved in detoxification and protection of cells from the oxidative stress induced during catabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates, such as ALDH9A1, CA3 and PIM3. Notably, an increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, along with an increased expression of c-MYC and activation of the WNT/β-catenin, is a feature of cancer stem cells [69].
        We also observed an enhancement in the expression of glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1), the gene involved in the channeling of glucose flux into hexosamine pathways. Notably, the global protein glycosylation level has been reported being increased upon c-MYC activation and elevated in cancer cells [70].
        Interestingly, the response to apoptosis and immune-related modules were coordinately downregulated (Figures 3, 10, 11), in line with the data on protein network presented in Figures 4B.
        Glycolysis and glutaminolysis are the main sources of carbon and energy
        Polyploid cells supporting highly biosynthetic metabolism need a source of energy and carbon supply to provide ATP and building blocks for DNA and protein synthesis. Notably, the c-MYC oncogene was found as playing a major role as a central organizer of the metabolic changes, which occur in transformed cells [12, 49].
        Our transcriptional metabolic analysis discloses that the main nutrients used by polyploid cells seem to be carbohydrates and aminoacids. Thus, we observed an enhancement of the levels of expression of the enzymes and modules involved in glucose, fructose and mannose and glutamine metabolism (Figure 9, Supplementary Tables S4–S6, S9 and S10), also known as a characteristic feature of cancer cells. In heart and liver this is combined with down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect), while mitochondrial respiration is high in placenta.
        As a summary of metabolome analysis, we conclude that the c-MYC-related metabolism of polyploid cells shows elevated protein turnover (synthesis and degradation) that employs carbohydrates and aminoacids as carbon and energy source. Thus, these polyploid cells not only express several EMT markers but also present the EMT-consistent metabolic features.
      
      
        RAS – a complementary partner of c-MYC for oncogenesis is enhanced and creates a hub in the polyploidy activated c-MYC interacting genes
        Studies on collaboration of two powerful oncogenes, c-MYC and RAS, have provided one of the basic concepts of carcinogenesis occurring in two steps ‘immortalisation/initiation” (amplified c-MYC) and transformation/promotion (mutated RAS) [7]. However, the complementation of c-MYC and RAS, which is sufficient and effective for full carcinogenesis as found in early studies still remains poorly understood [71, 72]. Therefore, up-regulation of the oncogenic module of MYC/RAS in polyploidy associated network deserves particular attention (Figure 4A).
        Both oncogenes are linked to stress response (first of all by JUN and FOS, AP-1 complex with c-MYC) via conservative MAPK pathway and they directly activate and stabilize each other [54]. More recent studies show that both RAS and c-MYC are most often induced from EGFR by EGF and TGFα (found here induced by polyploidy 6-, 4- and 2-fold, correspondingly) and converge on Cyclin D/Cdk2 (also induced) activating proliferation, where immortality may be supported by c-Myc [65].
        In view of the carcinogenic potential of MYC/RAS complementary pair revealed here in normal polyploidy cells, we undertook a more detailed study of the c-MYC related tumour suppressor TP53 interacting genes.
      
      
        TP53 and malignancy traits
        The tumor suppressor TP53 is a central coordinator of the adaptive cellular response to stress conditions that facilitates repair and survival of damaged cells or eliminates severely damaged cells [73–75], and most importantly, it is a main barrier of cells to cancer [54]. TP53 is enhanced in all three polyploid tissues, however only slightly (16%), while the down-stream CDKN1A/p21CIP1 (with its positive feedback to p53) is not activated, in spite of the up-regulation of the DNA damage response genes (Supplementary Table S1, Figure 4A). Suppression of senescence, apoptosis, and the relatively modest upregulation of p53 may suggest a lowered barrier of polyploidy cells to genome instability and malignancy. Moreover, c-MYC overexpression can compromise and override some of the TP53-dependent responses activated by cellular stress changing thereby the global cellular effects of TP53 activation [76]. In turn, tetraploidisation of cancer cells surpasses the effect of downregulation of p53 in their diploid conterparts as judged by survival in response to oxidative stress [77].
      
      
        Summary of results
        We conclude that c-MYC- related polyploidy favours the expression of cellular programs of malignancy-related pathways (TGFb/WNT, BMP/WNT-embryonality, EMT, stress response, DNA synthesis and repair, Warburg-type energy supply, and activation of complementary proto-oncogenes). The c-MYC related metabolome of polyploid cells supports stress response and energy saving pathways coupled to EMT (Figure 12).

            The scheme illustrates the main features of polyploidy-associated Myc interacting genes upregulation
            The upregulation of EMT and stemness master regulators as well as metabolic switch to glycolisis and glutaminolysis and enhanced protein synthesis and stress response pathways may suggest that polyploidy increases addiction to transformtaion.
          
          
        
      
    
    
      DISCUSSION
      Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution (T. Dobzhansky)
      
        c-MYC-related attraction of polyploidy to cancer represents an evolutionary toolkit for adaptation to stress
        We have undertaken this research to address two questions: (1) which properties of c-MYC confers polyploidy that may explain its role in promoting cancer; (2) why normal polyploid cells are not tumorous. Upregulation of c-MYC in polyploid cells of mammalian tissues has already been reported [12, 65], however c-MYC-interaction gene and protein network in polyploid cells have not been systematically analysed at a genome scale. PCA approach applied in our study, firstly, confirmed the fidelity of main results obtained by cross-species reciprocal comparison summarised above and, secondly, highlighted its evolutionary aspect. The found features of c-MYC related polyploidy, such as enhanced DNA repair, replication, and development, illustrate the adaptive and driving role of polyploidy in evolution, confirmed by mutual pathways with the whole genome duplications [78–80]. These adaptive features can explain 'addiction' of polyploidy to cancer. Moreover, PCA clearly exposed a single-cell organism module addressing origin of somatic polyploidy to the transition period from unicellular to multicellular organisms, which has occurred about 600 mln years ago [81, 82]. Segregation of germ and soma, division of labour, and gastrulation (movement of cell masses with EMT as its component [46]) were the first acquisitions of early multicellularians
        Therefore, it is worth noting that the c-MYC related TGFβ/Wnt pathways interacting with genes of the EMT program found here as playing a central role for normal somatic polyploidy are activated in embryogenesis from the gastrulation stage on. Thus, we revealed that normal differentiated cells developmentally polyploidised through abortive mitosis by c-MYC overexpression [12, 64, 65] become also embryonalised and stress-responsive by it. Obviously, by origin this program represents an evolutionary toolkit for adaptation to stress. These evolutionary traits of transient polyploidy linked to embryonalisation and exploiting c-MYC likely became usurped by cancer cells [83–87] conferring them resistance to treatments coupled with proliferative and metastatic potential. It appears that adaptive advantage of tetraploidy trades off the proliferative disadvantage of inevitable aneuploidy, explaining the “aneuploidy paradox” in cancer cells. Interestingly, studies by Duncan and colleagues showed that tetraploid mouse hepatocytes, when isolated and cultured display, contrary to wild type possessing normal karyotype in ~99% of cells, a high proportion of chromosome missegregations [37, 88]. Thus, in very stressful conditions, the genome of normally polyploid hepatocytes is prone to instability. In turn, genome instability as such promotes tumorigenicity [89]. Therefore, by all reasons, killing preneoplastic tetraploid cells is a useful strategy for cancer chemoprevention [90].
      
      
        However, why is normal polyploidy related to cancer but does not always cause cancer?
        The proclivity of c-MYC-polyploidy associated genes towards cancer contradicts the absence of active proliferation, genome instability, and cancer in these normal tissues. Notably, the shift towards embryonality of normal polyploid cells, which we have revealed and explored, remains in the developmental realm of gastrulation embryo. In spite of overexpressed c-MYC, which is tempered by wt TP53 and some negative feedbacks, it does not reach the pluripotent embryonal stem cell state (manifested by expressing OCT4/SOX2/NANOG associated programs) with their relaxed cell cycle checkpoints [91]. Such a state is often shared by aggressive primary cancers [92–95] and displayed by polyploidised cells of primary and established tumour cell lines resisting genotoxic stress [96–98]. The previously postulated cancer embryonic stem cell-like attractors [99–101] match between that of the two-cell embryo and that of onset of first lineage commitment [102]. As we have revealed here, physiological polyploidy in heart, liver, and placenta does not go that far in embryonalisation and genome destabilisation and therefore is separated from cancer.
      
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Data sources and pairwise cross-species comparative approach description
        To reveal the evolutionary conserved and thus functionally important effects of polyploidy on c-MYC regulated features, we investigated the activity of the c-MYC interacting genes in homologous tissues of mammalian species differing by ploidy and in polyploid vs diploid cells of the same tissue. The comparative cross-species and intra-species approach is instructive because evolutionary distance enhances the signals by helping to distinguish them from noise emanating from species- and tissue-specific effects [103]. The multi-level signal-to-noise filtration is particularly precautious for investigation of polyploidy because polyploidy may exert only weak and idiosyncratic effects on gene expression because of preserving gene-dosage balance [51].
        The approach of reciprocal cross-species comparison was developed and applied previously [34, 35, 104]. The data for the previous analysis were taken from Su et al. [105]. Since that time, the amount of annotated genes increased by more than 40% [1] and new bioinformatic approaches were developed, including the analysis of protein interactions. Altogether, these novelties allow us to step away from the conservative arbitrary 2–fold threshold for the expression difference that is appropriate only for analysis of strong effects and to accept the threshold of 15% that can be applied for evaluation of small fluctuations of gene expression [106, 107]. Finally, given that transcriptional regulators exhibit small expression amplitude, 15% expression difference may provide important information about the influence of polyploidy on transcription factors and chromatin regulators [106–108]. We performed the cross-species pairwise reciprocal comparison using the transcriptomic data for polyploid vs diploid organs, specifically, for human heart (polyploid) vs mouse heart (diploid) and mouse liver (polyploid) vs human liver (diploid). The transcriptomic data were from the database obtained from next generation sequencing (RNA-seq) by Brawand and colleagues, 2011 [109]. To increase the reliability of cross-species approach, we also analysed the genes selected from the microarray database [41] using the same cross-species reciprocal comparison algorithm. RNA-seq is more sensitive than microarrays [110], therefore the RNA-seq database was treated as a primary database, whereas the microarray data were considered as a secondary database providing additional support.
        To understand similarities in ploidy-associated gene regulation at the inter- and intra-species levels, we compared the results of the human and mouse heart and liver analysis with the results obtained for purified 4n and 2n cells of early mouse decidua taken from the microarrays database [111].
      
      
        Data normalization
        The analysis of RNA-seq data by Brawand and colleagues [109] was performed with the genes whose expression differed in the same direction with regard to ploidy in heart and in liver. In both comparisons the genes should have higher (or lower) expression in a polyploid tissue compared with a diploid tissue. Since we compared two different tissues in opposite directions in different species (human vs. mouse in the case of heart, and mouse vs. human in the case of liver), the effects of tissue-specificity and species-specificity were presumably removed. The same approach was applied for the microarray data by Wu and colleagues [41].
        The one-to-one human-mouse orthologous genes were obtained from the Homologene database [112]. The expression levels of orthologous genes were analyzed using the 'limma' package specially developed for revealing differentially expressed genes in whole-transcriptome analyses [113]. Comparison of different software packages showed that limma is the method of choice for goals similar to those pursued in our work [114]. It is especially valuable that limma allows analyzing in a similar way both RNA-seq and microarray data [113]. The data were normalized with quantile normalization implemented in limma and the differential gene expression (with its statistical significance) was determined on the ground of among-samples variation within each tissue within each species using the modified t-test implemented in limma. The intra-species analysis of 4n vs. 2n decidual mouse cell transcriptomes was performed similarly. These transcriptomes were from the work by of Ma and colleagues [111].
        Then, we selected the genes, which exhibited differential expression between polyploid and diploid tissues (cells) above 15%. As a result, we obtained three gene lists containing the genes that are common for heart, liver and decidua cells (Supplementary Table S1), for human heart and mouse liver (Supplementary Table S2), and for 4n vs. 2n early mouse decidua cells (Table 3). Then, these three gene lists were subjected to gene module enrichment analysis (see below the method description and Supplementary Tables S4, S5, S6).
        To identify genes with maximal ploidy association, we matched the genes that are common for heart-liver and decidua cells (Supplementary Table S1) (i.e. were obtained using the databases [109, 111] with the gene lists for human and mouse heart and liver obtained using the data bases [41]. The resulted gene list is presented in Table 1.
      
      
        Principal component analysis
        To find out, whether the results of cross-species gene-by-gene comparison can be confirmed by other bioinformatic approaches, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the raw data matrix having samples as variables and genes as statistical units.
        The idea is to confirm the gene-by-gene a priori approach with a data-driven strategy, letting a ‘ploidy’ specific principal component to emerge from the data. The principal components are orthogonal each other by construction, the data-driven emergence of a ‘pure ploidy component’ distinct from ‘tissue’ and ‘species’ components is equivalent to an unsupervised normalization for tissue and species effects. The genes endowed with extreme scores on such a ‘ploidy’ component are the ‘image in light’ of tissue and species independent ploidy effect on transcription pattern.
        For this propose we used microarray data [41] for human and mouse heart and liver. This approach enabled us to evaluate the impact of shared variable and species-specific, tissue-specific and ploidy-specific variables separately [52]. As a result, we obtained two lists of genes demonstrating statistically significant plody-asociated variation (not less 2 standard deviations) for human and mouse heart and liver (Supplementary Table S7) and for 4n/2n decidua cells (Supplementary Table S8). Then these gene lists were subject to gene module enrichment analysis and the modules that are regulated by ploidy in similar ways for heart-liver and placenta were identified (Supplementary Tables S9 and S10).
      
      
        Analysis of biological modules
        To find out which biological modules were over-represented among the ploidy-associated genes, we applied a double control. We tested the genes from all three data sets (Supplementary Tables S4–S6) with higher and lower expression in polyploid vs diploid tissues and cells, respectively, for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) categories and molecular pathways with regard to all human-mouse orthologous genes (13965 genes) and simultaneously with regard to all known orthologous c-MYC – interacting genes (3734 genes). The enriched GO categories and molecular pathways were found using the hypergeometric distribution of probability (implemented in R package) as in the previous work [115, 116]. GO categories were taken from GO database [117]. For each GO category, all its subcategories were collected using Gene Ontology acyclic directed graphs, and a gene was regarded as belonging to a given category if it was mapped to any of its subcategories. As a source of molecular pathways, the NCBI BioSystems was used, which is a most complete compendium of molecular pathways from different databases [112]. The redundancy was removed by uniting entries with identical gene sets. The adjustment for multiple comparisons was done according to method by Storey and Tibshirani [118]. This procedure gives q-value, which can be considered as p-value corrected for multiple tests.
        Significance levels were set at p<0.01 and q<0.15. We choosed these thresholds on the ground of recommentations of GSEA group and other authors [119, 120]. Protein-protein interactions were taken from the STRING database [1].

        nc886 is a recently identified cellular non-coding RNA and its depletion leads to acute cell death via PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated) activation. nc886 expression is increased in some malignancies, but silenced in others. However, the precise role of nc886/PKR is controversial: is it a tumor suppressor or an oncogene? In this study, we have clarified the role of nc886 in thyroid cancer by sequentially generating PKR knockout (KO) and PKR/nc886 double KO cell lines from Nthy-ori 3-1, a partially transformed thyroid cell line. Compared to the wildtype, PKR KO alone does not exhibit any significant phenotypic changes. However, nc886 KO cells are less proliferative, migratory, and invasive than their parental PKR KO cells. Importantly, the requirement of nc886 in tumor phenotypes is totally independent of PKR. In our microarray data, nc886 KO suppresses some genes whose elevated expression is associated with poor survival confirmed by data from total of 505 thyroid cancer patients in the Caner Genome Atlas project. Also, the nc886 expression level tends to be elevated and in more aggressively metastatic tumor specimens from thyroid cancer patients. In summary, we have discovered nc886's tumor-promoting role in thyroid cancer which has been concealed by the PKR-mediated acute cell death.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, whose worldwide prevalence has been soaring because of advances in medical imaging technologies and easy accessibility to ultrasonography [1, 2]. Since it remains asymptomatic even in advanced stages, many researchers have been seeking a biomarker to distinguish more aggressive tumors from indolent ones at the time of diagnosis. However, these efforts have not been successful.
      Growing evidence indicates a significance for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer (reviewed in [3]). These ncRNAs are either small [< 50 nucleotides (nts)] or long (>200 nts) in length and play a regulatory role in gene expression by degrading target mRNAs or determining the chromatin status of target genes [4]. nc886 (a.k.a. pre-miR-886 or vtRNA2-1) is a recently identified regulatory ncRNA that is medium-sized (101 nts long) [5]. Not only in size but also in several other aspects, nc886 is distinct from those small or long ncRNAs. First, nc886 controls gene expression by binding and modulating the activity of a protein called PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated). Second, nc886 is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) whereas a majority of regulatory ncRNAs are RNA polymerase II (Pol II) products.
      nc886's role in cancer was first noticed because of its expression pattern in a number of cancer cell lines and patient samples [5–10]. Previous studies from our laboratory and others highlighted its putative tumor suppressor role, based on its epigenetic silencing in some malignancies. However, several lines of data indicate that the elevation of nc886 expression is a more general phenomenon, especially during early stages of tumorigenesis. The nc886 level is much higher in proliferating cells than non-proliferating tissues [5]. For example, most immortalized cells express nc886 abundantly ([5–8] and unpublished data from YSL). In many cases, this high level of nc886 is sustained or becomes even higher, as immortalized cells progress into more transformed cells. The elevated expression of nc886 in cancer is seen also in miRNA profiling data where probes (against miR-886-5p and -3p) detected nc886 [11–14]. All these observations coincide with higher Pol III activity in cancer cells than normal cells (reviewed in [15]).
      nc886 plays a critical role in determining cell death or proliferation via its inhibitory function on PKR [6]. PKR was originally identified as a viral sensor that when activated upon viral infection led to cell death by phosphorylating eIF2α and consequently shutting down global cellular protein synthesis. In addition to viral sensing, PKR is involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways and is implicated in cancer. Although PKR's pro-apoptotic role initially suggested a tumor suppressor role, its precise function in cancer is still controversial (reviewed in [16]). In our published work [5, 6], epigenetic silencing of nc886 occurs in a subset of cancer cells (referred to as “nc886− cells” hereafter) and nc886 knockdown (KD) activates PKR and consequently induces apoptosis, similarly to viral infection. This result led us to propose a “tumor sensing model” in comparison to PKR's original viral sensing role, to illustrate the significance of nc886/PKR in eliminating pre-cancerous cells [17].
      Nevertheless, the precise role of nc886 in its relation with PKR in tumor promotion or suppression has yet to be elucidated. The elevated expression of nc886 in proliferating cells concurs with its oncogenic role which agrees with PKR's putative tumor suppressor function; however this idea has never been examined. Of course, nc886 may also play PKR-independent roles. Studies on nc886 have been hampered, because its depletion results in acute cell death via PKR activation. For this reason, it has been challenging to obtain an nc886− cell line from its isogenic nc886+ control cell line. Comparison between the two cell lines is essential in order to evaluate nc886's precise role in cancer. In this study, we have solved this problem by sequentially generating PKR and nc886 knockout (KO) cells and, for the first time, clearly determined their roles in thyroid cancer.

        Expression analysis of nc886 in patient samples and thyroid cell lines
        We measured the expression of nc886 in paired normal/tumor samples from 37 thyroid cancer patients and classified into three groups (low, medium, and high) according to nc886 levels (Figure 1A). Elevated expression of nc886 in tumors was correlated with the number of primary tumors (p=0.028, Table 1), tumor aggressiveness (see T staging in Figure 1B, p for trend=0.050) and metastasis to lymph nodes (p=0.028, Figure 1C). However, there was no signficant association of nc886 with clinical variables such as the age at diagnosis, the size of primary tumors, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease leading to chronic inflammation.

            A. qRT-PCR measurement of nc886 in 37 pairs of a thyroid tumor and its adjacent normal tissue. nc886 Ct values were normalized to 18S rRNA Ct values to calculate 2−ΔΔCt. Values of each tumor (black bars) are shown relative to its normal tissue whose values were set as 1 (plain bars). An average and the standard deviation from triplicate measurements are indicated. Patient identity is anonymously designated in #-number. Vertical dotted lines classify samples into low (tumor vs normal fc < 0.7), medium, and high (fc > 1.3) expression of nc886. The fc cutoffs were determined according to p-values (p < 0.05 in t-test) of the boundary samples. B-C. Sub-classification of patients in each nc886-expression group according to T staging (panel B) and lymph node metastasis (panel C). D. qRT-PCR measurement of nc886 in thyroid cell lines. The value of Nthy-ori 3-1 is set as 1. All other descriptions are the same as panel A.

        We also measured nc886 expression in thyroid cell lines and found it to be higher in the majority of cancer cell lines than in an immortalized cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 (Figure 1D). Nthy-ori 3-1 cells, although not fully-transformed, proliferated well and expressed nc886 much more abundantly than non-proliferating thyroid tissues (Supplementary Figure S1A). Very low expression of nc886 was also previously seen in normal tissues from several organs [5], suggesting that nc886 expression is proportional to cell proliferation rates. Actually, nc886 expression became less when cell proliferation was slowed by reducing the serum concentration in the culture medium (Supplementary Figure S1B).
        The above nc886 expression pattern, together with its association with cell proliferation in vitro as well as tumor progression and aggressiveness in patients, supported a putative oncogenic role in thyroid cancer. However, nc886 was epigenetically silenced in a subset of thyroid cells (Supplementary Figure S2A-B), as previously seen in other types of cancer including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and lung cancer [7–10]. Therefore we could not rule out the possibility of a tumor suppressor role. To clarify the role of nc886 in thyroid cancer, we attempted to assess its loss-of-function phenotypes.
      
      
        Acute cell death triggered by nc886 silencing and the consequent PKR activation
        As stated in the Introduction, nc886 is a repressor of PKR. When we transfected an antisense oligonucleotides (anti-oligo) targeting nc886 into Nthy-ori 3-1, SW1736, and C643 thyroid cell lines, nc886 expression level was diminished as shown by our Northern blot in Figure 2A. nc886 KD led to PKR activation, as indicated by the increase of phospho-PKR which is the active form (Figure 2B). The active PKR phosphorylated its best substrate eIF2α and consequently inhibited cell proliferation in the immortalized Nthy-ori 3-1 line as well as in a thyroid cancer cell line SW1736 (Figure 2A–2B). In contrast, neither eIF2α phosphorylation nor an effect on cell growth was observed in the other cancer cell line C643.

Summary of nc886 KD data from panel A-B and expected cellular outcomes upon nc886 KO.
          
          
        
        At first glance, this impaired cell proliferation upon nc886 KD seemed to agree with its putative oncogenic role. However, this phenomenon should be understood as the PKR-dependent “tumor sensing model” (see Introduction; [17]) rather than nc886's role in the etiology and/or progression of thyroid cancer. In other words, nc886 KD immediately provoked the PKR cell death pathway before we were able to observe any other phenotypes that could truly reflect the functional significance of nc886's elevated expression in immortalized or transformed cells. To elucidate this, it would be essential to examine long-term cellular phenotypes and make a comparison between nc886-null (nc886−) cells and isogenic nc886+ cells. Thus, nc886 KO cell lines were generated.
      
      
        Sequential generation of PKR and PKR/nc886 double KO cell lines
        Since anti-oligos do not self-propagate and thus are inappropriate for long-term KD, we took advantage of a new gene-editing technique adapted from a bacterial immune system composed of “Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)” and “CRISPR-associated genes (Cas)” (reviewed in [18]). PKR also posed a problem when generating nc886 KO cells because those cells (nc886−) are expected to die in the presence of PKR (Figure 2C). C643 cells could be a choice because they were resistant to PKR-mediated cell death (Figure 2A–2B). However, this resistance indicated that the PKR pathway had already gone awry. So it would be questionable whether any data from this cell line would appropriately reflect the role of nc886, in concert with PKR, in thyroid tumorigenesis.
        Our maneuver to solve this situation was to make PKR KO cell lines ahead of nc886 KO. In this way, comparison among wild type (designated as PKRwt/nc886wt), PKR KO (PKRKO/nc886wt), and double KO (PKRKO/nc886KO) will answer to the question about the precise contribution of nc886 and/or PKR in thyroid tumorigenesis. We chose Nthy-ori 3-1, because it is not a fully transformed cell line and so is likely to retain a more natural PKR pathway as compared to cancer cell lines. For the same reason, Nthy-ori 3-1 cells could transform in either direction: more tumorigenic or less upon nc886/PKR KO. This would be a considerable advantage because nc886 and PKR KO were expected to show opposite phenotypes.
        We designed a small guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting amino acid #15-21 in the first exon of the PKR gene (Supplementary Figure S3A). We selected PKRKO clones that were certified to have frameshifting 1-2 nt deletions by DNA sequencing (Supplementary Figure S3B-C) and accordingly no PKR protein expression by Western blot (Supplementary Figure S4A-B).
        Next we attempted to generate nc886KO from PKRKO clones. Because nc886 is an ncRNA, a deletion of 1-2 nts does not guarantee that it will be a functional KO. Therefore, we designed two sgRNAs (yellow highlighted in Supplementary Figure S5A) flanking the nc886 transcript (blue letters in Supplementary Figure S5A) in order to remove the whole DNA segment between them. These two sgRNA-expressing plasmids were transfected together into parental Nthy-ori 3-1(PKRwt) and Nthy-ori 3-1(PKRKO) cells. During initial selection of nc886KO candidate clones, we noticed that colonies were barely recovered from the original (PKRwt) Nthy-ori 3-1 cells whereas a decent number of colonies were recovered from all four PKRKO clones (Supplementary Figure S6). This result corroborated our idea that nc886 depletion is deleterious to cell proliferation and PKR activation is certainly one cause for it. We have obtained several PKRKO/nc886KO subclones which were confirmed by the appearance of a shorter PCR product indicative of a deletion of the nc886 DNA segment between the two sgRNAs (Supplementary Figure S5B) as well as by sequencing (a representative result from nc886KO clone #6 shown in Supplementary Figure S5C). We also ascertained no nc886 expression by Northern hybridization (Figure 3A) in three PKRKO/nc886KO clones (#6, #13, and #17 in Figure 3A) and used these cell lines to examine nc886's role in thyroid cancer.

An average and the standard deviation are calculated and shown.
          
          
        
      
      
        Retardation in cell growth, migration, and invasion in nc886KO cells
        Our MTT and colony formation assays demonstrated that PKRKO/nc886KO cells grew more slowly than nc886wt cells (PKRwt/nc886wt and PKRKO/nc886wt in Figure 3B–3D and Supplementary Figure S7A-C). PKR KO itself conferred a slight growth advantage, as could be seen by the larger colony sizes of PKRKO/nc886wt cells than those of PKRwt/nc886wt. However, MTT values and colony numbers were not so significantly increased in the absence of PKR (Figure 3B–3D and Supplementary Figure S7A-C). Cell migration and invasion assays yielded similar results. PKRKO/nc886KO cells were clearly less migrating and invasive than PKRKO/nc886wt cells; PKRKO/nc886wt cells were slightly more than PKRwt/nc886wt cells (Figure 4A–4D and Supplementary Figure S8A-D). Collectively from all these data, it was evident that nc886 played an oncogenic role.
        
          Figure 4
          
            Cell migration and invasion assays for PKR or nc886 KO cells
            Representative images after the assays panels A and C. and their quantification panels B and D. are shown. All the other descriptions (for example, the number of replicates for each cell line) are the same as Figure 3B-D.
          
          
        
        It should be noted that nc886KO cells were in the PKRKO-background and therefore all the phenotypes manifested by nc886 KO were PKR-independent. For example, nc886's pro-proliferative role cannot be attributed to its inhibition of PKR's pro-apoptotic function. If PKR inhibition were nc886's sole function, PKRKO/nc886KO and PKRKO/nc886wt cells would have shared an identical phenotype. Another important conclusion from our data is the contribution of PKR, which when alone appeared to play a marginal role.
      
      
        Gene expression profiling in PKRKO and nc886KO cells
        Next we further investigated the molecular basis of nc886/PKR's role. We performed microarray experiments in the three cell lines (PKRwt/nc886wt, PKRKO/nc886wt, and PKRKO/nc886KO) and obtained a list of 226 genes from expression changes between them (as diagrammed in Figure 5A; Supplementary Table S1 for the full list). As shown in a heatmap (Figure 5A, left panel), expression of 25 and 201 genes were altered respectively by PKR and nc886 KO. The microarray data were validated by measuring some altered genes by qRT-PCR (Figure 5A, right panel).

        We mainly focused on the 201 genes for further analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that 13 GO sets were altered significantly (p<0.05) upon nc886 KO and most of them were implicated directly or indirectly in tumorigenesis (Table 2). Among them, regulation of cell cycle, cell growth, and apoptosis as well as cytoskeleton organization (bold-highlighted GO terms in Table 2) might explain the nc886 KO phenotypes in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Figure 3–Figure 4). For example, the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as EGFR, HIPK2, HSPBL2 and TAX1BP1 (see “Negative regulation of apoptosis” in Table 2), was decreased upon nc886 KO (Supplementary Table S1) and this may explain the diminished growth of the PKRKO/nc886KO cells.

        We also performed a gene-network analysis using the GeneMANIA plug-in tool in Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/; [19]) to identify the direct physical interactions and interconnection of pathways among the 201 genes. In this network (Supplementary Figure S9), p53 and MYC were prominent hubs. p53 and MYC are the most renowned tumor suppressor and oncogene respectively and, interestingly, are known to modulate Pol III transcription and therefore nc886 expression ([15] and our unpublished data). Further studies will be needed to unravel the relation of nc886 to p53, MYC, and the 201 genes.
        Next we sought to examine data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to interrogate further nc886's clinical significance. The TCGA does not contain expression data of nc886 itself, because nc886 belongs to neither mRNA nor miRNA and therefore was excluded from most array or sequencing platforms. Instead, we examined expression of the 201 nc886-regulated genes in the TCGA RNA-seq data from 505 thyroid cancer patients (Supplementary Figure S10) to analyze their implication in patient survival. We observed that lower expression of ANLN, C5orf13 (= NREP), COL5A1, VGLL2, C15orf52, and KIAA1644 was significantly (p<0.05) associated with longer survival of the patients (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S11), in agreement with their lowered expression levels upon nc886 KO.
        The array data were also analyzed against the molecular signature database (MSigDB; http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) to see which transcription factor (TF) target genes were enriched or depleted (Supplementary Figure S12A and Supplementary Table S2). We could not find any consistent elevation or depletion of TF targets upon nc886 KO. This was not so surprising because nc886 is exclusively localized to the cellular cytoplasm [5] and so any direct effect on TFs would be unlikely. Only one exception was the serum response factor (SRF) signature which was enriched upon nc886 KO (Supplementary Table S2). It needs to be clarified whether the increased activity of SRF was a direct consequence of nc886 KO.
        Although PKR KO exhibited marginal phenotypes (Figure 3–Figure 4) and also only a moderate change in gene expression (Figure 5A), we found a number of TF target genes to be altered significantly (Z-score cutoff = 3; Supplementary Figure S12A). Nine top altered TFs (Z-score cutoff = 4) were all depleted in PKRKO cells and notably seven were the NF-κB TF (dark blue bars in Supplementary Figure S12B). In addition, our pathway analysis using Biocarta identified one enriched pathway and 13 depleted pathways (Z-score cutoff = 4; Supplementary Figure S12C) among which seven were implicated in NF-κB (dark blue bars in Supplementary Figure S12C). This result corroborated the long-standing idea that PKR is the upstream of NF-κB.
      
    
    
      DISCUSSION
      In this study, we have clearly determined nc886's role in thyroid cancer using CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene KO and provided a novel finding that nc886 plays a putative oncogenic role (summarized in Figure 6). nc886 expression is elevated in clinical samples. nc886 KO led to decreased tumor phenotypes and also to altered expression of a set of genes, some of which have been identified as supportive of nc886's putative oncogenic roles. For example, nc886KO cells had elevated expression of CDKN2C and DKK1, known to inhibit thyroid cell proliferation and migration when overexpressed [20, 21]. However, the expression of ANLN, and C5orf13 (a.k.a. NREP and P311) was decreased in nc886 KO (Figure 5). These genes have been reported to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and migration when suppressed [22, 23] and their lower expression was associated with good survival of patients in the TCGA cohort (Figure 5). Therefore, nc886 and some of its associated genes could be an informative marker in deciding the extent of surgery in preoperative settings and in determining the dose of radioactive iodine therapy after surgery to improve the patient's outcome.

          Summary cartoon for nc886's role in thyroid cancer
        
        
      
      We also clarified PKR's role in thyroid tumorigenesis in this study. To the best of our knowledge, our report is the first to utilize PKR KO human cells to evaluate tumor phenotypes. From our data in PKRKO cells, PKR per se plays an insignificant role or only a very slight tumor suppressor role. Our results here correspond with several lines of mouse data having shown no evident tumor phenotypes from PKR-null mice [24] or having indicated a moderate tumor suppressor role in certain experimental conditions [25, 26]. We surmise that PKR, only when activated, can play dual roles in cancer: inducing apoptosis to eliminate pre-cancerous cells or triggering pro-inflammatory responses. Apoptosis affects tumorigenesis negatively but a pro-inflammatory response affects a malignancy positively. In either case, PKR is not a direct driver or suppressor in tumorigenesis. Rather, we infer that the activation of PKR serves as a sentinel or a facilitator in cancer. In this regard, it would be informative to consider nc886's role in relation with PKR in thyroid cancer. Our results here showed that nc886 silencing occurred in some thyroid cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S2) as reported in other types of cancer [7–10] and that nc886 KD activated PKR (Figure 2). More efforts will be needed to elucidate the contribution of nc886/PKR to thyroid tumorigenesis.
      In summary, we have uncovered nc886's putative oncogenic role in thyroid cancer (Figure 6). Previous studies have highlighted nc886's putative tumor suppressor role mainly because its epigenetic silencing was more easily recognized in cancer cells. We presume that nc886's role in cancer is multifaceted and that its precise function will be determined by several factors such as cancer types, stages, and cellular contexts. Since it is clear from our data that nc886's oncogenic function is independent of PKR, we are currently seeking to identify its regulatory target molecule(s) in order to elucidate definitely the molecular mechanisms of malignancy.
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Cell lines and tissue samples
        The following cell lines were used in this study: Nthy-ori 3-1, an SV-40 immortalized cell line derived from normal primary thyroid follicular epithelial cells [27]; BCPAP, KTC-1, SNU-790 from papillary thyroid carcinoma; FTC133 from follicular thyroid carcinoma; C643, SW1736, and Cal-62 from anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (for SNU-790, [28]; for all other cell lines, [29] and references therein). Nthy-ori 3-1 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); BCPAP and Cal-62 were from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Germany); C643 and SW1736 were from CLS (Cell Line Service, Germany); and KTC-1, SNU-790 and FTC133 lines are our laboratory stocks (National Cancer Center, Center for Thyroid Cancer, Korea). Cells were cultured in appropriate growth media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; Logan, UT, USA) and 1% antibiotic-antimyotic (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA). All cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37°C.
        Normal and tumor tissues were obtained from thyroid cancer patients who underwent thyroid surgery at the National Cancer Center (NCC) Hospital. All fresh tissues were frozen immediately after surgery in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C according to the protocols approved by the institutional review board, NCC for the human subject guideline of NCC (NCC2014-0003) that is in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Hospital medical records and pathology reports of 37 patients who underwent surgery and diagnosed as papillary thyroid cancer in our clinic were reviewed. Pathologic staging was defined according to the TNM classification system of International Union against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7th edition. The clinical and pathological features of the patient are summarized in Table 1.
      
      
        Transfection, anti-oligos, RNA/protein isolation and measurement
        The source of general reagents was described in [5, 6, 8]. Anti-oligos (“anti886 75-56” and “anti-vt 21-2” which are designated as “anti-nc886” and “anti-control” respectively in this work) were prepared and transfected as described in [5]. Total RNA from patient tissue samples and cell lines was isolated by Trizol reagent (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA). Northern hybridization, qRT-PCR measurement of nc886 and control genes, Western blot of PKR and other proteins were performed as previously described [5]. Sequence information on qRT-PCR primers is available upon request.
      
      
        Generation of CRISPR/Cas KO cell lines
        “hCas9” and “gRNA_Cloning Vector” were purchased from Addgene (plasmid #41815 and #41824 respectively). A sgRNA-expressing plasmid for PKR (“pCR sgPKR-1a”) was a kind gift from Dr. Stacy Horner at Duke University. sgRNA-expressing plasmids for nc886 were constructed according to the gDNA synthesis protocol (https://www.addgene.org/41824/ and [30]). Briefly, inserts were made by annealing two partially complementary oligos containing sgRNA sequences (shown in Supplementary Figure S5A) and converting into a fully double-stranded DNA fragment by Phusion™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs; Ipswich, MA, USA). The inserts were incorporated into AflII-linearized “gRNA_Cloning Vector” by using the Gibson assembly kit (New England Biolabs), to yield “pCR sg886-164” and “pCR sg886+15”.
        The Cas9-expressing plasmid (“hCas9”), in combination with “pCR sgPKR-1a” (for PKR KO) or with “pCR sg886-164” and “pCR sg886+15” (for nc886 KO), was transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). Untransfected cells were processed in parallel as a negative control during G418 selection. At 24 hrs after transfection, cells were transferred to a growth medium containing 1 mg/ml of G418. G418-resistant colonies were individually isolated and further cultured.
      
      
        Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays
        Cell proliferation measurement was based on the conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye or its derivative MTS dye. MTT and MTS dyes were purchased respectively from Sigma-Aldrich and Promega (Madison, WI, USA) and assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In colony formation assays, 100 cells were seeded into one well of a 6-well plate and maintained for 7 days. Colonies were fixed and stained with 1% crystal violet to count colony numbers.
        Cell migration assays were performed using 8-μm pore filter insert (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA). Cells were resuspended in a serum-free RPMI-1640 medium, were added onto the upper chamber, and were allowed to migrate to the lower chamber containing RPMI-1640 with 1% FBS for 24 hrs. Migrated cells on the bottom surface of the insert were fixed, air-dried for 20 min, and stained with 1% crystal violet for 20 min. Remaining cells on the top surface were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. To quantify migration rates, inserts were placed in 10% acetic acid and the absorbance at 564 nm was measured. Cell invasion assays were conducted with matrigel-coated insert (BD Biosciences). Cells were stained with Diff-Quik stain™ (Sysmex; Kobe, Japan) and counted.
      
      
        mRNA microarray and pathway analysis
        mRNA expression profiling and analysis of molecular signatures were performed as described in [7, 8]. Hierarchical clustering and generation of a heat map were done by using Cluster 3.0 and Java TreeView (version 1.1.6r4) softwares. Direct physical interactions and their corresponding pathways were estimated using the “GeneMANIA” Cytoscape plug-in function (http://www.cytoscape.org/) [19].
      
      
        TCGA data analysis
        RNA-seq data and clinical data from 505 thyroid cancer patients were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp). A total of 20,132 genes available in the TCGA RNA-seq data were collected for further analysis. TCGA provides RNA-seq data in Expectation-Minimization values (RSEM) as normalized expression levels. Expression fold-change (fc) of a gene was estimated by dividing the RSEM of a gene by the average of RSEM estimated from the total 505 patient samples and was log2-transformed. Following the procedure previously reported [31], RSEM values of 0 ~ 0.1 were all replaced to 0.1 to avoid the infinity problem in calculating the expression fc. According to expression levels of a selected gene, the patients were classified into “high-expression group” (if a log2(fc) value is > 0)” and “low-expresion group” (< 0), as described previously [32]. Among 201 nc886-regulated genes (Figure 5), 189 genes were found in the gene list of the TCGA RNA-seq data and were used for survival analysis (see Supplementary Figure S10). The R studio was used for all statistical tests and analyses (http://www.rstudio.com/). The ‘survival’ packages were used (http://r-forge.r-project.org) to draw Kaplan-Meier curve and to calculate the Cox proportional hazard ratio.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Descriptive analyses were performed to identify patient demographics. For analysis of categorical variables, frequencies and percentages were calculated. The patients were divided into three groups (low, medium, and high) according to the expression of nc886 in thyroid cancer tissues. Proportions in each group were compared using the χ2 and Fisher's exact test. For analysis of continuous variables, means and standard deviations were determined. The differences of the continuous variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test, Student's unpaired two-sided t-test or a one-way ANOVA. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA software (version 10, StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA). All p-values were two-sided, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

        Increasing evidence suggests that ion channels not only regulate electric signaling in excitable cells but also play important roles in the development of brain tumor. However, the roles of ion channels in glioma remain controversial. In the present study, we systematically analyzed the expression patterns of ion channel genes in a cohort of Chinese patients with glioma using RNAseq expression profiling. First, a molecular signature comprising three ion channel genes (KCNN4, KCNB1 and KCNJ10) was identified using Univariate Cox regression and two-tailed student's t test conducted in overall survival (OS) and gene expression. We assigned a risk score based on three ion channel genes to each primary Glioblastoma multiforme (pGBM) patient. We demonstrated that pGBM patients who had a high risk of unfavorable outcome were sensitive to chemotherapy. Next, we screened the three ion genes-based signature in different molecular glioma subtypes. The signature showed a Mesenchymal subtype and wild-type IDH1 preference. Gene ontology (GO) analysis for the functional annotation of the signature showed that patients with high-risk scores tended to exhibit the increased expression of proteins associated with apoptosis, immune response, cell adhesion and motion and vasculature development. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results showed that pathways associated with negative regulation of programmed cell death, cell proliferation and locomotory behavior were highly expressed in the high-risk group. These results suggest that ion channel gene expression could improve the subtype classification in gliomas at the molecular level. The findings in the present study have been validated in two independent cohorts.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      Ion channels, membrane proteins expressed in all living cells, create pathways for charged ions, including calcium (Ca2+), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl−) ions. During the last few years, ion channels have been demonstrated to play critical roles in gene expression, immune response, cell volume regulation, cell migration, and cell proliferation [1–3]. Particularly, there is increasing evidence that ion channels are involved in the progression of human cancers [4–7] and ion channel genes-based signature has the potential role in prognosis of breast cancer and lung cancer [8, 9].
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary central nervous system tumor with a current median survival of approximately 15 months [10]. Despite continuous progress in neurosurgery, the infiltrative behavior of gliomas precludes complete tumor resection and is certainly the primary reason for the poor clinical outcome for patients [11, 12]. Ion channel genes have been demonstrated that play an important role in brain tumor metastasis [13, 14].
      In this study, we used RNASeq datasets from CGGA and a set of 280 ion channel genes to identify an ion genes-based signature for clinical outcomes of primary GBM (pGBM) patients. We then built a predictive model based on the three ion genes that correlated overall survival (OS) and validated the model by applying it to the TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets. The three ion genes signature identified patients who had a high risk of unfavorable outcome were sensitive to chemotherapy.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Identification of a three ion channel genes signature for prognosis in pGBM patients
        A total of 280 ion channel genes were collected for the present study (Additional file 1: Supplementary Table S1). To identify ion channel genes which were associated with grade progression, we first compared genome expression in grade II or grade IV gliomas with that in grade III gliomas (II VS III and III VS IV) in CGGA dataset of gliomas, then a two-sided log-rank test was used to analyze each ion genes in GBM patients. Finally, three channel genes (KCNN4, KCNB1 and KCNJ10) were identified to be significantly correlated with malignant progression and associated with OS (Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary Table S2). The expression value of KCNN4 is upregulated and KCNB1 and KCNJ10 are downregulated in gliomas. We then applied the three genes as a signature to develop a risk score formula by using the risk score method. The risk score for each patient was then calculated. Using the median risk score as the cutoff value, the patients were successfully divided into a high risk group and a low risk group. The patients with the high risk score had a shorter median OS than patients with the low risk score in GBM and pGBM. (p < 0.001) (Figure 1A–1B). The risk score and OS distribution were shown in Figure 2A and 2B.

        We then determined the dependence of the signature of clinicopathological and molecular parameters in pGBM patients from CGGA database by multivariate Cox regression analyses. All the parameters (Table 1) were selected based on our clinical experiences that were related to prognosis. We found that the risk score, chemotherapy and radiotherapy status were statistically associated with OS. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the risk score was an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05) (Table 2).

        Validation of the prognostic value of the three genes signature in two additional datasets
        Further, we validated the independent predictive power of the three genes signature in the TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets. For the 158 and 183 pGBM in TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets, we used the same β value obtained from the training set to calculate the risk scores. Patients were also divided into high risk group and low risk group according to the risk score (cutoff: median risk score). The prognostic value of the signatures was validated by the two datasets (p < 0.01 for all the two datasets, Figure 1C–1D). The risk score and OS distribution were also shown in Figure 2A–2B.
        We then validated the dependence of the signature of clinicopathological and molecular parameters in pGBM patients from TCGA datasets by multivariate Cox regression analyses. The parameters related to prognosis were selected (Table 1). We found that the risk score, age and IDH1 status were statistically associated with OS. Multivariate Cox analysis validated that the risk score was an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05) (Supplementary Table S3).
      
      
        The three ion genes-based signature assisted predicting the efficacy of chemotherapy in pGBM patients
        To determine whether the three genes signature assists in predicting the efficacy of postoperative radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) in pGBM patients, we extracted the therapeutic information available for 83 pGBM patients in the CGGA datasets (Figure 3A, p < 0.001). According to risk scores, 27 patients (6 patients underwent RT and 21 patients underwent RT+CT) were stratified to the high-risk group and the other 31 patients (7 patients underwent RT and 24 patients underwent RT+CT) to the low-risk group. Among high-risk pGBM patients, a more favorable survival benefit was observed in the RT+CT treatment group compared to the RT alone group (Figure 3C, p < 0.01), while OS did not differ significantly between RT+CT and RT alone treatment group among low-risk pGBM patients (Figure 3B, p > 0.05).
        
          Figure 3
          
            The signature predicted the efficacy of radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in pGBM patients
            (A, D) pGBM patients in CGGA and TCGA treated with RT + CT showed a better prognosis than those with RT alone. (B, E) Benefit of RT + CT was observed in the high risk group with significantly improved OS (p < 0.05). (C, F) The addition of CT to RT did not improve OS of patients in the low risk group (p > 0.05). RT, radiotherapy; CT, chemotherapy; LR, low risk group; HR, high risk group.
          
          
        
        We then used 158 pGBM patients treated with standard RT with or without CT in TCGA databases to confirm the therapeutic predictive value of the signature (Figure 3D, p < 0.05). Similarly, RT+CT was only beneficial for the high-risk pGBM patients (21 RT/57 RT+CT) but not for the low-risk pGBM patients (15 RT/59 RT+CT) (Figure 3E–3F). The findings indicate that high-risk pGBM patients were sensitive to chemotherapy.
      
      
        The three genes signature showed a subtype preference
        Considering the promising potential of the three ion genes signature in predicting clinical therapies, we next screened the expression of the three genes signature in different molecular glioma subtypes. We found that tumors of patients with high risk scores obviously displayed TCGA Mesenchymal subtype and wild-type IDH1 preference in the three datasets of CGGA, TCGA and REMBRANDT (P < 0.001, respectively) (Figure 4A–4B).

            (A) The high risk score tumors displayed Mesenchymal subtype and wild-type IDH1 preference. (B) The differentially expressed genes were shown arranged from the low to high risk score. Pink represents the high expression of genes in the high risk group; blue represents the low expression of the genes in high risk group.
          
          
        
      
      
        Functional Annotation of the three genes signature
        In order to find out the functional basis of the notable difference in prognosis, we also performed SAM on high and low risk group in three datasets. After 1000 times of permutation test, those genes with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01 were considered to be differentially expressed between the two groups. By screening the top 1000 increased expression genes, the overlapped genes (424 genes with increased expression in high risk group, Additional file 1: Supplementary Table S4) were chosen for further analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the associated genes, among those highly expressed in the high-risk group, were primarily associated with the apoptosis, immune response, cell adhesion and motion and vasculature development (Figure 5A). Furthermore, GSEA results showed that pathways associated with negative regulation of programmed cell death, cell proliferation and locomotory behavior were highly expressed in the high-risk group (Figure 5B).

      DISCUSSION
      In recent years, the gene expression-based molecular classification of gliomas has rapidly developed [15, 16]. Previous studies suggested that a multiple ion channel genes-based risk signature can provide a more statistical analysis than a single gene [8, 9]. The aim of our study was to identify a small group of genes whose expression predicts survival in pGBM gliomas and can be readily measured. We first identified three ion channel genes (KCNN4, KCNB1 and KCNJ10) significantly associated with OS of pGBM patients, then we designated the three genes as the three ion gene-based signature. The ion gene signature was then demonstrated as a promising prognostic molecular signature for predicting the OS in three independent cohorts from different regions worldwide. We also observed the preferred expression of the ion gene signature in mesenchymal subtype and wild-type IDH1.
      In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that downregulation of ion channels is an important mechanism in drug resistance via impairment of cell death [17, 18]. As drug resistance to chemotherapy is the major challenge in the treatment of pGBM, it will be increasingly important to identify patients who do not benefit from chemotherapy and who may be candidates for early treatment with chemotherapy. In our study, among high-risk pGBM patients, a more favorable survival benefit was observed in the RT+CT treatment group compared to the RT alone group (p < 0.01). However, OS did not differ significantly between RT+CT and RT alone treatment group among low-risk pGBM patients. The findings indicate that the low-risk patients should avoid unnecessary chemotherapy treatment since it usually causes toxic side-effects.
      Several studies reported that ion channel genes play the important role of apoptosis, proliferation, cell migration [2, 14, 19–21]. In our studies, GO analysis revealed that patients with high-risk scores are likely associated with the apoptosis, immune response, cell motion and vasculature development. GSEA results showed that pathways associated with negative regulation of programmed cell death, cell proliferation and locomotory behavior were highly expressed in the high-risk group.
      Previous studies have investigated the prognostic roles of the three ion channel genes in the process of tumors. These three genes are all included in the family of the potassium channels. KCNB1 (Kv2.1) is the principal voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel underlying delayed-rectifier currents (IDR) in most mammalian brain neurons. We identified KCNB1 was associated with malignant progression and outcome in gliomas. Moreover, KCNB1 plays an important role in the autophagy induction via activation of the ERK signaling pathway (manuscript in submission).
      KCNN4 (KCa3.1) channels belong to the Ca2+-activated potassium channel superfamily and the activation of these channels is dependent on conformational changes in calcium calmodulin [22]. Previous researches have revealed that KCNN4 channels regulate cell cycle progression and cell growth in human endometrial cancer and prostate cancer cells [23, 24]. More importantly, KCa3.1 channels are involved in the infiltrative behavior of glioblastoma and significantly enhances glioma invasion [21, 25, 26].
      KCNJ10 (Kir4.1), is the predominant K+ channel in mature astrocytes and responsible for establishing the astrocytes negative resting membrane potential [27]. KCNJ10 was demonstrated as overexpressed in glioma cells and promoted cell differentiation and inhibited growth in gliomas [28].
      Limitation of this study includes the fact that it is a retrospective research and three ion genes-based signature was generated from the small population of the validation datasets. For clinical application, a larger independent dataset in a prospective study is required.
      In summary, we identified a novel three ion channel genes-based signature with independent prognostic significance for pGBM that can be a useful tool for identifying patients who would most benefit from chemotherapy treatment.
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Patients and samples
        All glioma samples included in our study were from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), which were composed of 109 grade II gliomas, 41 grade III gliomas and 83 primary GBM. The patients underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2009. Patients were eligible for the study if the diagnosis of glioma was established histologically according to the 2007 WHO classification. These patients underwent surgery and were followed-up at Beijing Tiantan hospital. Clinicopathological data, including gender, age, pathologic diagnosis and the results of molecular analysis were obtained.
        Whole transcriptome sequencing of 233 gliomas were obtained from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database (http://www.cgga.org.cn) [29]. The other two datasets were downloaded from the repository for the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (http://cancergenome.nih.gov) and the molecular brain neoplasia data (REMBRANDT, http://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/rembrandt).
        The definition of human ion channel genes was obtained from GeneCards [30, 31] and IUPHAR-DB [32]. In total, we collected 280 ion channels, including voltage-dependent and non-voltage-dependent ion channels.
      
      
        Signature development
        Patients surviving more than 90 days were eligible for the study since too short survival time were more likely resulted from severe complication rather than glioma occurrence. Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the interval from the day of first surgery to death or the end of follow-up. Firstly, an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare the expression value of each gene in grade II or grade IV gliomas with that in grade III gliomas (II VS III and III VS IV) in three datasets of gliomas (CGGA, TCGA, and REMBRANDT). Then, the prognostic difference of a certain gene was calculated by the Univariate COX regression analysis with log-rank test by packages (survival) of R to get the corresponding Hazard Ratio (HR) in each grade. Then genes which were associated with grade progression and significant prognostic value (p-value < 0.05) were used to developed a linear combination of the gene expression level (expr) weighted by the regression coefficient derived from the univariate Cox regression analysis (β). As a result, we identified three ion channel genes, which were then used as a signature for prediction utility assessment. Based on the three-gene signature, the risk score for each patient was calculated as follows:
Risk score=exprgene1×βgene1+exprgene2×βgene2+…+exprgene n×βgene n
        According to this model, the patients having higher risk scores were expected to have poor OS. Patients of every grade in the training dataset were stratified into a high-risk or a low-risk group by using the 50th percentile risk score as the cut-off. We used the same β in the validation sets.
      
      
        DAVID analysis of associated genes in gliomas
        Significant analysis of microarray (SAM) was performed in pGBM to identify differently expressed genes, followed GO [33] and GSEA analysis of the differently expressed genes highly expressed in the high risk score group.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 5.0 by Student's t test or Mann–Whitney test. The associations between risk score and clinicopathological features were tested by Pearson Chi-Square test. Kaplan–Meier and log-rank methods were used to compare OS curves using SPSS version 20. Statistically significant variables in the univariable analysis were included in multivariable analysis using Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical tests were two-sided. A difference was considered significant when p < 0.05.

        PSMB5 mutations and upregulation of the β5 subunit of the proteasome represent key determinants of acquired resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) in leukemic cells in vitro. We here undertook a multi-modality (DNA, mRNA, miRNA) array-based analysis of human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and BTZ-resistant subclones to determine whether or not complementary mechanisms contribute to BTZ resistance. These studies revealed signatures of markedly reduced expression of proteolytic stress related genes in drug resistant cells over a broad range of BTZ concentrations along with a high upregulation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) gene expression. MARCKS upregulation was confirmed on protein level and also observed in other BTZ-resistant tumor cell lines as well as in leukemia cells with acquired resistance to other proteasome inhibitors. Moreover, when MARCKS protein expression was demonstrated in specimens derived from therapy-refractory pediatric leukemia patients (n = 44), higher MARCKS protein expression trended (p = 0.073) towards a dismal response to BTZ-containing chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we show a BTZ concentration-dependent association of MARCKS protein levels with the emergence of ubiquitin-containing vesicles in BTZ-resistant CEM cells. These vesicles were found to be extruded and taken up in co-cultures with proteasome-proficient acceptor cells. Consistent with these observations, MARCKS protein associated with ubiquitin-containing vesicles was also more prominent in clinical leukemic specimen with ex vivo BTZ resistance compared to BTZ-sensitive leukemia cells. Collectively, we propose a role for MARCKS in a novel mechanism of BTZ resistance via exocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins in BTZ-resistant cells leading to quenching of proteolytic stress.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (BTZ, Velcade®) is registered for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma [1, 2] and is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in other hematological malignancies, such as pediatric acute leukemia [3]. Through reversible inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the β5 subunit and to a lesser extent the caspase-like activity of the β1 subunit of the 20S proteasome, BTZ specifically blocks proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins [4, 5]. Consequently, misfolded and poly-ubiquitinated proteins accumulate thereby activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) [6, 7]. The balance between protein production and the extent of degradation inhibition plays a key role in the cytotoxic activity exerted by BTZ [7]. Moreover, inhibition of multiple pro-survival pathways [8–13] contribute to the BTZ induced apoptosis. Despite the proven efficacy of BTZ, development of drug resistance is an emerging obstacle [14]. Although the mechanism underlying BTZ resistance in hematological malignancies is only partly understood, several proteasomal and non proteasomal-related factors involved in BTZ resistance have been suggested [14–17]. With respect to the latter, upregulation of heat shock proteins [18–20], drug extrusion by P-glycoprotein [21–23], upregulation of P21(WAF1/CIP1) [24], activation of the AKT/mTOR pro-survival pathway [25], downregulation of XBP1s [26], decreased CIP2A activity [27] and Noxa/Bcl-2 protein interactions [28] have been suggested to be implicated in BTZ-resistance. Proteasome-related mechanisms of BTZ resistance are associated with differential upregulation of β5 subunit along with downregulation of immunoproteasome subunit [21, 29–34]. Specifically, in acute leukemia cell lines and childhood ALL and AML leukemic blast cells, a lower ratio of immunoproteasome subunits over constitutive subunits was associated with a decreased sensitivity to BTZ [35]. Remarkably, reversing this balance towards increased immunoproteasome subunits upon treatment with interferon-γ exposure restored BTZ sensitivity in BTZ-resistant leukemic cells [31]. Moreover, acquisition of PSMB5 mutations and upregulation of mutated β5 subunits were frequently identified in hematological tumor and various solid tumor cell lines which conferred high levels of BTZ resistance in vitro [14, 17, 21, 29, 32, 36–39]. The identified mutations in PSMB5 form a cluster in a region that encodes for critical amino acids within or in close proximity to the BTZ- binding pocket of the β5 subunit resulting in decreased BTZ binding [29, 40]. Next generation proteasome inhibitors displayed differential capacities to overcome BTZ in hematological cells, but appeared themselves prone to the development of drug resistance by mechanisms including PSMB5 mutations [41, 42]. A currently open question is how BTZ-resistant cells harboring PSMB5 mutations handle proteolytic stress upon exposure of increasing BTZ concentrations. Examining the ability of BTZ to inhibit the catalytic activity of the mutated β5 subunit revealed a 2-fold lower potency as compared to non-mutated β5 subunits, whereas the cell growth inhibitory capacity was repressed by a factor of > 100 fold [29, 41]. These findings suggest that BTZ resistant cells acquired additional compensatory mechanism(s) to cope with the proteolytic stress. To gain further insight into these underlying molecular mechanisms, we undertook a multi-modality (DNA, mRNA, miRNA) array-based analysis of human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and two subclones harboring PSMB5 mutations, one with a moderate and one with a high level BTZ resistance. These studies revealed a highly upregulated myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) gene expression which correlated with protein expression. Moreover, MARCKS protein expression was associated with a BTZ concentration-dependent vesicular secretion of ubiquitinated proteins. The relevance of this novel function of MARCKs in BTZ resistance was further corroborated in BTZ and second generation proteasome inhibitor resistant hematological cell lines, ex vivo BTZ-resistant pediatric ALL cells, and clinical specimens of ALL children receiving BTZ-containing chemotherapy.
    
    
      RESULTS
      To identify novel mechanisms of BTZ resistance, the human CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line and its BTZ-resistant sublines, i.e. CEM/BTZ7 (10-fold resistance), CEM/BTZ100 (140-fold resistance) and CEM/BTZ200 cells (170-fold resistance) [31, 43] were studied and analyzed in a multi-modality array-based analyses including comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), micro-RNA (miRNA) and gene expression (GEP) arrays.
      
        ArrayCGH analysis
        ArrayCGH analyses of two BTZ-resistant subclones were compared to parental CEM/WT cells. Genetic alterations identified in CEM/BTZ7 cells included: a deletion of small area of the long arm of chromosome 5, a duplication of a large area on the end of the long arm of chromosome 11, a near complete duplication of the long arm of chromosome 14 as well as a complete loss of one of the three X-chromosomes (Supplementary Figure S1A). Of note, chromosome 14 harbors multiple proteasomal subunits, including PSMB5 (β5) and PSMA3 (α7) which we were previously shown to be upregulated at the protein level in the BTZ-resistant CEM lines [29]. In addition, a limited number of small duplications and deletions on different chromosomes were observed. Similar genetic alterations were identified in CEM/BTZ200 cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). Karyotype analysis of CEM/WT and CEM/BTZ200 cells confirmed the loss of chromosome X and duplication of chromosome 14 (Supplementary Figure S1C and S1D).
      
      
        miRNA array analysis
        miRNA array analysis was performed to identify possible regulatory miRNAs involved in BTZ resistance. Figure 1 shows all differentially expressed miRNAs in CEM/BTZ100 and CEM/BTZ200 cells as compared to parental CEM/WT cells. Among the most down-regulated miRNAs were the hypoxia-induced miR-210 [43], the Myc down-regulated miR-23a [44], the hematological differentiation inducing miR-150 (reviewed in [45]) and the possible tumor suppressor miR-149 [46]. Of the upregulated miRNAs, miR-181c has been associated with cell proliferation [47, 48] and miR-19b has been correlated with 5-FU resistance [49]. In contrast to these miRNAs supporting pro-survival, two other upregulated miRNA's have been described to have the opposite effect. miR- 101 has been described to be a pro-apoptotic factor in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia [50] and miR-7 as an tumor suppressor inhibiting various receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR [51], IGF-1R [52] and p21 activated kinase (PAK1) [53]. miR-29b, which was recently shown to target the proteasome subunit PSME4 and disrupt the autophagosome pathway in BTZ-resistant MM cells [54], was not down-regulated in CEM/BTZ cells, indicating non-overlapping profiles in BTZ-resistant acute leukemia and MM cells. An overview of expression validated target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs is presented in Supplementary Table S1. Differentially expressed miRNAs were not located on amplified or deleted genomic regions identified in the arrayCGH analysis.

        Gene expression profile (GEP) analysis
        In order to identify differences in response to BTZ exposure in sensitive and BTZ resistant CEM cells, parental CEM/WT cells were treated with 7 nM BTZ for 24 hours (CEM/WT_BTZ) and compared to the different resistant sublines, treated for 24 hours with a concentration of BTZ on which they normally thrive (CEM/BTZ7 with 7 nM, CEM/BTZ100 with 100 nM and the CEM/BTZ200 with 200 nM of BTZ). Ratios of gene expression were calculated as compared to untreated parental CEM/WT. Figure 2 shows the 50 most upregulated and downregulated genes after treatment of CEM/WT cells with BTZ for 24 hours. After clustering, 2 groups with highly differentially expressed genes between CEM/WT_BTZ and all resistant subtypes were identified. The right top side of Figure 2 shows a closer view of cluster 1, containing genes highly down-regulated in CEM/WT_BTZ cells which were essentially unchanged in the BTZ-resistant CEM sublines. The functions of the genes in cluster 1 were diverse and affected pathways including: cell proliferation, immune response, TGF-β pathway and transcriptional regulation. When focusing on cluster 2, the genes upregulated in the CEM/WT_BTZ and unchanged in the BTZ-resistant cell lines are nearly all involved in UPR, apoptosis or JNK cascade signaling (Figure 2 right, bottom). Clearly, the stress response observed in the CEM/WT cells by BTZ was not observed in the BTZ-resistant CEM cells.

            The figure depicts this selection of genes for all CEM variations as a ratio of the untreated CEM/WT cells.

        Of the highest differentially expressed genes comparing the CEM/WT_BTZ to the CEM/BTZ7, several genes overlapped with the genes found in clusters 1 and 2 (Figure 2) and several other genes were identified (Figure 3A). Among the genes that were down-regulated in the BTZ-resistant CEM lines as compared to the CEM/WT_BTZ cells were several stress-related genes (including DNAJB1, DDIT3, HSP1 and HSPA1A) and immune-related genes (including CXCL2, CXCL3, and IL-8). The most down-regulated gene was XIST, which resides on the X-chromosome and which is in concordance with our array CGH analysis.

Results for all CEM variations are depicted as a ratio of the untreated CEM/WT. Red color represents upregulation, whereas green downregulation of expression.
          
          
        
        The list of upregulated genes contains several genes encoding for enzymes involved in detoxification (including ALDH7A1, ALH2, GSTM3 and DHRS2), CD1 genes (CD1A, CD1D and CD1E), the cell cycle gene TERT and several genes involved in cytoskeleton regulation and vesicle migration (ENAH, SCRN1 (SES1), SGEF, TMSB15A, C9orf58 (AIF1L) and MARCKS. Of all genes, MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate) was the most differentially overexpressed gene with a 25- to 42-fold upregulation in the BTZ-resistant leukemia cell lines.
        It has been shown that BTZ induces upregulation of multiple proteasomal genes after short-term drug exposure [10]. The expression of constitutive proteasomal genes in CEM/WT cells was upregulated upon BTZ exposure (Figure 3B). Interestingly, only a small difference was observed in proteasomal gene expression when comparing parental cells and BTZ-resistant tumor cell lines after 24 hours of BTZ treatment. Upon BTZ treatment, CEM/WT cells displayed an upregulation of the constitutive proteasome along with down-regulation of the immune proteasome (i.e. subunits PSMB8, PSMB9 and PSMB10). In BTZ-resistant cell lines, apart from upregulation of the constitutive proteasome, expression of immune proteasome was largely normalized to CEM/WT levels.
        To gain more insight into the interaction between upregulated and downregulated genes, pathway as well as gene set enrichment analysis was performed. Using the GeneGo tool, several protein stress pathways known to be involved in BTZ-induced cytotoxicity [6, 7, 55], including “apoptosis and survival endoplasmic reticulum stress response” and “protein folding response to proteins stress” were identified showing upregulation of several genes in CEM/WT_BTZ as compared to untreated parental CEM/WT cells (Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). When CEM/BTZ7 was compared with CEM/WT_BTZ, a downregulation of these pathways was observed (Supplementary Figure S2A and S2C). An overview of the top identified affected network processes including these protein stress pathways when comparing CEM/WT_BTZ to the untreated parental CEM/WT cells is shown in Table 1 (left column). In contrast, when the resistant CEM/BTZ7 cells were compared with CEM/WT_BTZ, the opposite trend was observed in these pathways (Table 1, right column) indicating a lack of stress in these BTZ-resistant cells.

            Corresponding P-values are given for the identified pathways. Pathways analysis was performed using GeneGO on significant altered genes (P < 0.05) and with a fold change > Log2.
          
        
        Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed upregulation of several stress-related gene sets in CEM/BTZ cells, including the set of genes most significantly changed after exposure to the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin (gene set CONCANNON_APOPTOSIS_BY_EPOXOMICIN_UP [56]). Proliferation, protein metabolism and MYC-related gene sets were down-regulated. In contrast, the CEM/BTZ7 gene expression profile was enriched for MYC-regulated genes and did not show upregulation of protein stress gene sets. (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, miRNA expression was correlated with GEP. In this selected gene list, pathway analysis was performed as well. An overview of the highly affected pathways is depicted in Table 2. Apart from comparable pathways including protein handling and apoptosis, several cytoskeleton-associated pathways were identified. Collectively, these data indicate that ER stress is most likely to be the dominant mechanism of BTZ-induced cytotoxicity in parental CCRF-CEM cells. Whereas, the diminished stress observed in drug resistant CEM/BTZ7 cells suggests a novel resistance mechanism circumventing the UPR.

        MARCKS upregulation
        To confirm the upregulation of MARCKS in BTZ-resistant leukemia cell lines at the protein level, Western blot analysis was performed as described previously [29]. Figure 4A shows a marked 500 fold upregulation of MARCKS in CEM/BTZ200 cells as compared to parental CEM cells. Consistently, a 60 fold upregulation was found in the previously described BTZ-resistant AML cells (THP-1/BTZ200) [32] as compared to THP-1/WT (Figure 4A). Remarkably, MARCKS was also upregulated in the recently established CEM and THP-1 (1500 fold and 5 fold respectively) sublines with acquired resistance to the immunoproteasome inhibitor PR-924 [42] and a CEM subline (630 fold) with acquired resistance to the proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A (marizomib) [41] (Figure 4B). Next to MARCKS expression, levels of phosphorylated MARCKS were examined in CEM/WT and CEM/BT200 cells. Notably, CEM/BTZ200 cells expressed a low basal level of phosphorylated MARCKS, which was inducible upon stimulation of cells with PMA and only partially blocked (35% pMARCKS reduction) by treatment with MANS [57] (Figure 4C).

        Vesicle-mediated ubiquitin exocytosis
        MARCKS protein was previously shown to be involved in multiple exocytosis pathways [58], e.g. mucin secretion [59], mast cell degranulation [60] and membrane targeting of plasmalemmal precursor vesicles during axon development [61]. Since gene expression profiling studies for CEM/BTZ cells (Figure 3) revealed that apart from MARCKS, several other genes involved in exocytosis, mostly cytoskeleton rearrangement genes, were also upregulated, we hypothesized that vesicle-mediated export of accumulated ubiquitinated proteins contributes to BTZ resistance through bypassing the proteasome and the UPR. To explore this hypothesis we first investigated whether or not the ubiquitinated proteins co-localized with MARCKS in vesicles in BTZ-resistant sublines. We subsequently determined the secretion of vesicles by BTZ-resistant sublines by following the uptake of vesicles by recipient HeLa cells after 24 hour exposure to supernatant derived from BTZ-resistant sublines. Figure 5A depicts the results of the background staining in the untreated parental CEM/WT showing hardly any MARCKS protein and moderate levels of ubiquitin. After 24 hour exposure of CEM/BTZ7 cells to 30 nM BTZ, MARCKS was upregulated when compared to parental CEM/WT cells. Moreover, ubiquitin was increased, partly in vesicular structures, and partly as a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. CEM/BTZ200 cells exposed to 400 nM BTZ displayed a clear co-localization of ubiquitin with MARCKS mostly in vesicle-like structures (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S4). Of note, co-localization was not observed with phosphorylated MARCKS (not shown). After exposure of HeLa cells to supernatant of CEM/WT cells we performed immunocytochemical staining to detect possible ubiquitin-containing vesicles (Figure 5B). These vesicles were not identified in HeLa cells exposed to supernatants of any of the untreated CEM/WT or BTZ-resistant sublines. When CEM/BTZ7 cells were exposed to 7 nM BTZ, a drug concentration on which they normally thrive, no uptake of vesicles was noted in HeLa cells. However, when CEM/BTZ7 cells were more stringently stressed with 30 nM of BTZ, uptake of ubiquitin-containing vesicles started to appear; the most pronounced uptake of ubiquitin-containing vesicles by HeLa cells was observed after the addition of a supernatant of CEM/BTZ200 cells treated with 400 nM BTZ. Further support to the hypothesis that the secretion of ubiquitin is indeed vesicle-mediated, was achieved by PKH67 staining. Figure 5C shows co-localization of ubiquitin and PKH in CEM/BTZ7 and CEM/BTZ200 after treatment with 30 nM and 400 nM BTZ, respectively. Moreover, when supernatants of these cell cultures were added to HeLa cells, co-localization of ubiquitin and PKH was observed in recipient cells (Figure 5D), indicating the uptake of ubiquitin-containing vesicles. No uptake was seen in untreated WT and BTZ-resistant cells. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the ER stress that is normally observed after aggresome formation of aggregated ubiquitinated proteins is circumvented in BTZ-resistant CEM cells by exocytosis of vesicles containing the aggregated ubiquitinated proteins.

(E) Ubiquitin (green) and MARCKS (red) staining in a primary ALL patient samples, one sensitive to BTZ (LC50: BTZ 6 nM) and one resistant to BTZ (LC50 BTZ: 262 nM) (F) without and after incubation with low concentration (7 nM) or high concentration of BTZ (400 nM). In the merge figure, the co-localization of the two proteins is shown in yellow. The right top of the figures depict a quantification using a line scan through the corresponding area of interest (α and β).
          
          
        
        To confirm these findings for primary patient samples, we selected a pediatric ALL patient displaying ex vivo sensitivity to BTZ (LC50: 6 nM, Figure 5) and compared it to a BTZ-resistant patient sample (LC50: 262 nM). Figure 5E and 5F show MARCKS and ubiquitin expression in these leukemic cells after 24 h exposure to a low dose (7 nM) and a high dose (400 nM) of BTZ. At low BTZ concentrations, the sensitive patient sample readily shows high ubiquitin and MARCKS expression with some co-localization. When this sample was incubated with high concentration of BTZ, vitality of the cells was heavily compromised along with diffuse staining of both proteins. The BTZ-resistant patient sample exposed to a low dose of BTZ shows some diffuse upregulation of ubiquitin as well as MARCKS expression. When this sample was incubated with 400 nM BTZ, ubiquitin and MARCKS show clear co-localization in small vesicular structures inside as well as outside the cell. The level of co-localization is quantified in the corresponding line scan. Together, these data show that the phenomenon of ubiquitin exocytosis by BTZ-exposed cells is also observed in primary patient samples.
      
      
        MARCKS and BTZ resistance
        We assessed whether PMA-stimulation of MARCKS phosphorylation or inhibition of MARCKS phosphorylation by either the inhibitory peptide MANS [62] or inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by staurosporine or UCN01 had an impact on BTZ sensitivity in CEM/BTZ200 cells. However, neither of these conditions appeared to alter BTZ sensitivity (Supplementary Figure S3; (A); BTZ dose response curve after PMA stimulation or MANS inhibition; (B) co-incubation with a concentration range of UCN-01 or (C) staurosporine). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of MARCKS by 56% (Supplementary Figure S3D) did not influence BTZ sensitivity (Supplementary Figure S3E; BTZ dose response curve after MARCKS siRNA). These data do not support a causal role of MARCKS in the described exocytosis mechanism and show that partial knockdown of MARCKS is insufficient to restore BTZ sensitivity.
      
      
        Clinical prognostic value of MARCKS expression
        Given the overexpression of MARCKS in BTZ-resistant leukemia cells, we explored whether or not MARCKS overexpression may serve as predictive marker of BTZ unresponsiveness in clinical samples of acute leukemia patients. To this end, we examined primary leukemic specimens of patients from the phase II childhood refractory/relapsed ALL trial (AALL07P1 study, NCT00873093) in which BTZ is administered in two intensive re-induction regimens containing vincristine, prednisone, PEG-asparaginase, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide and etoposide followed by methotrexate treatment. In these pretreatment samples we determined MARCKS expression levels using Western blot analysis and explored the correlation with the clinical response [Complete remission (CR) or no complete remission (No-CR)]. Figure 6 shows MACRKS expression in the CR and no-CR groups (β-actin and CEM/WT normalized). Twelve out of 30 patient specimens (40%) in the CR group did not show MARCKS expression when compared to 4 out of 14 (29%) in the no-CR group. MARCKS expression in the CR group was lower as compared with no-CR group (median 13.4 vs 50.3), with a trend for statistical significance (P = 0.073).

      DISCUSSION
      The current study reports a novel mechanism of exocytosis-mediated extrusion of vesicle-like structures containing ubiquitinated proteins in BTZ-resistant CEM leukemia cells as a novel modality to overcome proteolytic stress over a broad range of cytotoxic BTZ concentrations. MARCKS protein was identified as a BTZ resistance biomarker associated with the intracellular emergence of these vesicle-like structures. Furthermore, ubiquitin-containing vesicles from supernatants of BTZ-treated resistant CEM/BTZ cells were taken up by HeLa cells, hence confirming actual exocytosis of the ubiquitin-containing vesicles. Thus, through exocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins, the proteasomal load is decreased during proteasome inhibition, leading to cell survival. As proof of principle, this phenomenon was confirmed in two primary ALL patient samples. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing an association between resistance to proteasome inhibitors and exocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins.
      The concept of disposal of abundant ubiquitinated proteins is supported by our gene expression profiling and miRNA data. It is well established that accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins as a result of proteasome inhibition induces an unfolded protein response (UPR) in several tumor models [6, 14, 63–65]. Pathway analysis of BTZ-treated CEM/WT cells also showed enrichment for unfolded protein response and ER-stress pathways. Interestingly, upon BTZ exposure, BTZ-resistant leukemia cell lines showed a major reduction of active protein stress-related pathways, indicating a resistance mechanism circumventing UPR. This phenomenon has also been found to be reduced in BTZ-resistant mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) [66] and multiple myeloma [67, 68]. Apart from stress-related pathways, correlation of miRNA expression with gene expression identified cytoskeleton-associated pathways as being altered in BTZ-resistant CEM cells (Table 2). This latter pathway is involved in transport of vesicles, hence lending further support to the exocytosis hypothesis (reviewed in [69]). In addition, pan-genomic profiling of CEM/BTZ cells confirmed the genetic basis of the previously reported upregulated expression of mutated PSMB5 (β5) as a mechanism of BTZ resistance [29].
      Apart from proteasomal degradation, the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway and autophagy have been described in transport and selective removal of ubiquitinated proteins. In the ESCRT pathway, membrane proteins are taken up in endosomes and fuse with lysosomes resulting in the degradation of its content [70]. However, since ubiquitin is removed from membrane proteins before endocytosis through the ESCRT, ubiquitin-containing vesicles would not be present. Hence, this mechanism is not likely to be involved in the BTZ-resistant CEM cells.
      Secondly, under conditions of proteasome protein overload or energy deprivation, proteins and intact organelles can be degraded by lysosomes through autophagy [71]. In the context of proteasome inhibition or overload, autophagy of ubiquitinated protein aggregates is of interest [72, 73]. While autophagosomes normally fuse with lysosomes resulting in degradation of the aggresome, exocytosis of phagosomes has been opted in a process called exophagy [74]. Although increased autophagy, mediated by increased HSPB8 expression, has recently been demonstrated to be involved in BTZ resistance in multiple myeloma cells [20], we found no increased activity of this pathway in BTZ-resistant CEM cells. Our GEP data showed no upregulation of autophagy-related proteins, including HSPB8, while even a downregulation of the autophagy initiator SQSTM1 was seen (data not shown). In addition, the autophagy marker LC3B was not increased in BTZ-resistant cell lines as determined by Western blot and immunocytochemistry (data not shown) and hence does not explain the phenomenon of vesicular exocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins we describe in this paper.
      Buschow et al. [75] recently showed exosomes that were relatively enriched for ubiquitinated proteins as compared to total cell lysates [76]. Although their model was postulated, the exact mechanism of biogenesis and release of these exosomes was not elucidated. Since autophagy/exophagy and an ESCRT-dependent pathway are not supported by our data, BTZ- resistant CEM cells may have adopted the activation of an ESCRT-independent pathway as has been described by Buschow et al. By PKH labeling, ubiquitin-containing vesicles/exosomes emerging in CEM/BTZ cells during increasing BTZ concentrations were characterized by double membrane structures which remained intact during cellular release, interaction and accumulation in HeLa recipient cells. As such, these cells which are proteasome activity proficient have the capacity to process polyubiquitinated proteins.
      Our GEP studies identified the MARCKS gene to be highly overexpressed in BTZ-resistant CEM cells. The association of MARCKS protein with BTZ resistance was originally identified by Micallef et al. [77] in MM RPMI 8226-R5 cells with acquired resistance to the farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 and 3-fold cross-resistant to BTZ [78]. Unlike CEM/BTZ cells, RPMI8226-R5 cells had no mutations in the PSBM5 gene. Recently, Yang et al. [79] showed that upregulation of phosphorylated MARCKS in three BTZ-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines as well as in primary resistant MM specimens. They showed that low levels of BTZ resistance achieved through MARCKS regulating the SKP2/p27Kip1 cell cycle pathway [79, 80]. Consistently, in leukemia cells we show here the upregulation of MARCKS protein in CEM/BTZ cells as well as CEM cells with acquired resistance to new generation proteasome inhibitors Marizomib and PR924 [41, 42]. However, unlike MM cells, in leukemia cells we noted marginal basal levels of MARCKS phosphorylation suggesting no major involvement in leukemia cells that were selected for BTZ resistance. Notably, high levels of unphosphorylated MARCKS may be concordant with other well established functions of MARCKS in secretion processes [58–62]. Specifically, membrane-bound unphosphorylated MARCKS, rather than cytoplasmic phosphorylated MARCKS, can be a partner protein in facilitating transport of vesicles along the cytoskeletal axis and their secretion [61, 81]. This function would be consistent with co-localization studies of intracellular MARCKS and ubiquitin-containing vesicles and MARCKS not being associated with secreted vesicles. To this end, our encouraging preliminary correlations of MARCKS expression and BTZ response in pediatric acute leukemia patients warrant follow up study in a large cohort of BTZ-treated ALL.
      In conclusion, BTZ resistant T-ALL CEM cells displaying upregulation of mutant PSMB5, have a coexisting novel mechanism of exocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins, hence circumventing UPR (Figure 7). Both mechanisms are readily observed in resistance to several proteasome inhibitors indicating common resistance adaptation to proteasome inhibitors rather than limited to BTZ only. Further research is warranted to determine whether or not MARCKS is a clinical biomarker which can predict proteasome inhibitor resistance and may aid to select patients for BTZ- containing treatment strategies.

          Summary model of the involvement of MARCKS and vesicular exocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins in BTZ-resistant leukemia cells
          CEM/BTZ cells harboring PSMB5 mutations (indicated by *) have a diminished capacity of inhibition of proteasomal catalytic activity by BTZ [29, 31]. Upon exposure of CEM/BTZ7 and CEM/BTZ200 cells to BTZ concentrations that block PSMB5 activity (30 nM and 400 nM BTZ, respectively), these cells accumulate polyubiquitinated proteins. This coincides with the biogenesis of vesicle-like structures incorporating these ubiquitinated proteins. These vesicles then traffic along actin/cytoskeleton axis to the plasma membrane with MARCKS protein serving as partner protein. Here myristoylated-anchored MARCKS facilitates exocytosis of vesicles which subsequently can be taken up by recipient (HeLa) cells. Proficient proteasomal activity in recipient cells would allow degradation of ubiquitinated proteins from BTZ-resistant cells. Through a mechanism of exocytosis-mediated extrusion of vesicles containing ubiquitinated proteins, BTZ-resistant cells can overcome proteolytic stress over a broad range of BTZ concentrations.

        Sample preparation
        Wild type CCRF-CEM cells were harvested for RNA isolation after 24 hours of incubation with 7 nM BTZ (CEM/WT_BTZ). The several BTZ resistant sublines were cultured without BTZ for 7 days, prior to a 24 hour exposure on the BTZ concentration on which they normally thrive (CEM/BTZ7 with 7 nM, CEM/BTZ100 with 100 nM and the CEM/BTZ200 with 200 nM of BTZ). Expression ratios were calculated using the untreated CEM/WT as a reference. CEM/BTZ-200, referring to CEM/BTZ200 cells cultured in absence of BTZ for several weeks, were included as an additional reference but were not exposed to BTZ prior to gene expression array experiments.

        Total RNA was isolated using RNAbee (AMSBiotechnology), according to the protocol provided by AMSBiotechnology. Nanodrop ND-1000 was used for accurate nucleic acid concentration measurements. Quality control was performed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) in combination with the Agilent RNA 6000 NanoLabChip kit to visualize and quantify the amount of RNA. Samples with a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of > 7, concentration of > 5 μg/ml and two distinct peaks corresponding to the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands at a ratio of 1.8–2.0 as seen on Agilent electrophorogram were used.
      
      
        Expression microarray
        After RNA isolation, labeling (labeling performed with Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit, Agilent Technologies) and purification were undertaken (RNeasy Mini Kit, Agilent Technologies). Equal amounts of Cy3-CTP and Cy5-CTP labeled samples were hybridized to Agilent 4 × 44 K Whole Human Genome arrays (Agilent Technologies) the design of which can be found in the GEO [84] platform GPL4133 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization was carried out for 17 h with rotation at 65°C in a hybridization oven. Microarrays were scanned using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies), and scans were quantified using the Agilent Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies).
      
      
        Expression data pre-processing
        Raw expression data generated by the Feature Extraction software were imported into the R statistical environment using the LIMMA package [88] in bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org). After background correction, the intensity distributions within and between arrays were normalized using the Loess [89] and quantile [90] algorithm, respectively. Raw and normalized data are online available on the GEO [84] platform GSE74634. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74634).
      
      
        miRNA expression array
        The miRNA expression profiles of the samples were profiled using Agilent human miRNA Microarray V2 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Each array contained 60-mer probes representing 723 human and 76 human viral miRNAs from the miRBase (Version 10.1) the design of which can be found in the GEO [84] platform GPL8227 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). The array experiment was carried out using Agilent miRNA system protocol v2.0. Briefly, each RNA sample was labeled with Cyanine3-pCp and hybridized to the Agilent human miRNA microarray using the miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit (Agilent p/n 5190–0456). The slide was washed using Gene Expression Wash Buffer kit (Agilent p/n 5188–5327), and then scanned using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner. The raw miRNA expression data were extracted from the scanned image using Agilent Feature Extraction Software V10. Coefficient of variation (CV) within groups of replicate probes was used as a quality control measure to reflect the intra-array reproducibility. The raw expression values of miRNA were imported into Agilent GeneSpring Software V10 for normalization and identification of differentially expressed miRNAs between bortezomib-resistant and wild-type cells.
      
      
        Data analysis
        After normalization as described above, basic data handling and data preparation for further analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2010, clustering and subsequent visualization was performed using Cluster 3.0 and Treeview [91]. GO gene annotation was obtained from Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [92], pathway analysis and gene set enrichment analysis were performed using GeneGoMetacore (http://www.genego.com/metacore.php) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, Broad institute) [93, 94]. Integrated analyses of DNA copy number, gene expression microarray and miRNA expression data were performed as described by Menezes et al. [95] and Van Iterson et al. [96].Raw and normalized data are online available on the GEO [84] platform GSE74632. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74632).
      
      
        Immunocytochemistry
        Cytospins were fixed for 10 min with 4% of paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS pH 7.4, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% of Triton-X100 in PBS and blocked with 10% of fetal calf serum (FCS) in PBS for 1 hour. Primary (anti-MARCKS diluted 1:50, anti-ubiquitin 1:20) and secondary antibodies (diluted 1:100) were incubated for 1 hour each at 4°C. Nuclei were stained with 300 nM 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images of the cell line experiments were obtained using the Zeiss Axiovert 200M Marianas™ inverted microscope connected to a cooled Cooke Sensicam SVGA CCD camera [Cooke Co., Tonawanda, NY] as previously described by Wojtuszkiewicz et al. [97]. DAPI, Alexa 488 and Alexa 647 were irradiated with a pulsed laser at 405 nM, 499 nm and 654 nm respectively. A 63× oil objective with NA 1.4 was used to image the sample. Data collected were processed using SlideBook™ software (SlideBook™ version 5.5.2.0 [Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO]). The data acquisition protocol included optical planes to obtain 3-D definition.
        Confocal scanning laser microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X (Leica Microsystems) as previously described by Wojtuszkiewicz et al. [97]. Abberior STAR 580 and Alexa 647 were irradiated with a pulsed white light laser at 588 nm and 654 nm respectively. A 100× oil objective with NA 1.4 was used to image the sample.

        Background: Improved healthcare and recent breakthroughs in technology have substantially reduced cancer mortality rates worldwide. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed genomic analysis of the human transcriptome. Now, using NGS we can further look into small non-coding regions of RNAs (sncRNAs) such as microRNAs (miRNAs), Piwi-interacting-RNAs (piRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nuclear/nucleolar RNAs (sn/snoRNAs) among others. Recent studies looking at sncRNAs indicate their role in important biological processes such as cancer progression and predict their role as biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Results: In the present study, we data mined publically available small RNA sequencing data from colorectal tissue samples of eight matched patients (benign, tumor, and metastasis) and remapped the data for various small RNA annotations. We identified aberrant expression of 13 miRNAs in tumor and metastasis specimens [tumor vs benign group (19 miRNAs) and metastasis vs benign group (38 miRNAs)] of which five were upregulated, and eight were downregulated, during disease progression. Pathway analysis of aberrantly expressed miRNAs showed that the majority of miRNAs involved in colon cancer were also involved in other cancers. Analysis of piRNAs revealed six to be over-expressed in the tumor vs benign cohort and 24 in the metastasis vs benign group. Only two piRNAs were shared between the two cohorts. Examining other types of small RNAs [sn/snoRNAs, mt_rRNA, miscRNA, nonsense mediated decay (NMD), and rRNAs] identified 15 sncRNAs in the tumor vs benign group and 104 in the metastasis vs benign group, with only four others being commonly expressed. Conclusion: In summary, our comprehensive analysis on publicly available small RNA-seq data identified multiple differentially expressed sncRNAs during colorectal cancer progression at different stages compared to normal colon tissue. We speculate that deciphering and validating the roles of sncRNAs may prove useful in colorectal cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and therapy.
      
    
      Introduction
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third-most common cancer diagnosed in the United States in both men and woman, and the American Cancer Society estimates 134,490 new cases and 49,190 deaths in 2016 1. Despite recent improvements in cancer care and awareness, incidences are still steadily growing. Although colonoscopy has allowed for earlier detection, a better understanding of tumor biology and prognosis are still needed. Recently, advances in RNA sequencing have increased the understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind CRC. Changes in whole transcriptome profiles seem to underlie specific phenotypes. Small non-coding RNAs consist of 17-120 nucleotides, in their mature form 2 and play crucial roles in the development and progression of cancer. Innovative technologies have allowed researchers to focus on the role of small RNAs in disease progression which may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic targets. An increasing number of published studies have focused on miRNAs (17-22 nucleotides) 3, piRNAs (26-33 nucleotides) 4, small nucleolar RNAs (70-120 nucleotides) 5, and lncRNAs (>200 nucleotides) 6. Using whole genome sequencing, present studies aim to understand the functions and transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are one of the largest classes of the small non-coding RNAs family, and have been implicated in DNA methylation and post transcriptional-mediated repression of transposable elements 7. However, other hypothesized functions of piRNAs remain largely unexplored 8. Similarly, limited functional information is available for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) 9. Likewise, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in eukaryotes consist of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which carry out the fundamental role of ribosomal (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) modification and processing 10. Two classes of snoRNAs, C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs, have been shown to differ in sequence and structure 10.
      In the present study, we carried out in-depth data analysis to identify the transcriptomic expression “signatures” of small RNAs from benign, tumor, and metastatic tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients, using existing datasets. We thoroughly analyzed the most predominant ncRNA expression in each sample type along with signaling pathways for possible biomarker development and identification of therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer.
    
    
      Materials and Methods
      
        Samples and data assembly
        Colorectal cancer (CRC) small RNA sequencing (eight matched patients; 8 benign, 8 tumors, and 8 metastasis) datasets (project no: PRJNA201245; GEO: GSE46622) were downloaded from the NIH bioproject 11. Detailed clinical information of patients was previously mentioned by Rohr et al 11. Raw files were downloaded as sequence raw archive (SRA) files that were converted to FASTQ using SRA tool Kit version 2.5.7. Data was assembled using PartekFlow® software, version 5.0 (Partek, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). Converted FASTQ files were uploaded to the PartekFlow® server and remapped to human genome hg19 (UCSC Genome Browser). Transcript abundances were determined and expression values were represented using reads per kilobases of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM). All small RNA expression RPKM values >1 and representing at least 10% of the samples were considered robustly expressed and used for further analysis. Expression matrices were aligned to clinical pathologic features in order to compare miRNA, piRNA, lncRNA, and snRNA levels for association with specific CRC phenotypes. Statistical analysis between benign, tumor, and metastasis groups were carried out using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test followed by false discovery rate (FDR) correction through the Benjamin-Hochberg method, with the default p value <0.05 considered statistically significant 12.
      
      
        Assembly of miRNA, piRNA, lncRNA and snoRNA annotations
        Small RNA sequencing data was trimmed and aligned to the whole human genome (hg19), and BWA-0.7.12 aligner (BWA-MEM) with a few modifications (mismatch penalty 2, gap open penalty 6, clipping penalty 4 and alignment score cutoff 15) for short read mapping 13. miRNAs were annotated from miRBase version 21 (http://www.mirbase.org/), which contains more than 1900 high confidence miRNAs 14. piRNA data was generated and annotated from piRBase (regulatoryrna.org/database/piRNA), which is manually curated with a focus on piRNA functional analysis 15. lncRNAs were quantified using reference annotation LNCipedia (http://www.lncipedia.org) version 3.1, downloaded from all coordinates relative to the hg19 reference genome 16. Total small RNA (including miRNA, piRNA, snRNA, mtRNA, snoRNA, piRNA, tRF3, tRF5, tRNA, rRNA) was annotated following download of GenCode version 21 (www.GenCodegenes.org), which provides comprehensive, up-to-date information on human small non-coding RNAs, with specific regard to small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs.
      
      
        Biological processes and gene network visualization: MetaCore
        To investigate biological pathway interactions of small RNA expression, we used MetaCore pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY) 13, 17, to delineate functional gene networks. This was based on differentially regulated gene lists with p<0.05 from each group (tumor vs benign, metastasis vs benign, metastasis vs tumor) as input (Data analyzed by Gene Arrays, New York, USA) to generate disease biomarkers and GO terms.
      
      
        Statistical Analysis
        All data sets were subjected to paired student's t test with “p” value <0.05 being considered statistically significant. Furthermore, the Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing adjustment method was applied to all small RNA sequencing studies and pathway analysis.
      
    
    
      Results and Discussion
      
        Analysis of miRNA sequencing of colorectal cancer tissue samples
        To identify miRNA differential expression in colorectal cancer patient-matched tissue samples, data was downloaded from the GEO series accession number GSE46622. Using PartekFlow software miRNA analysis, we identified 19 miRNAs in the tumor vs benign cohort, and 38 miRNAs in the metastasis vs benign cohort, that were statistically significant. Top upregulated/downregulated miRNAs were determined in both tumor, metastasis stages (Figures 1A and 1B, Table 1), and hierarchical clustering/Venn diagram was compared for each group (Figure 1C). Our findings were very similar to those originally published by Rohr et al 11, in which one of the top downregulated microRNAs was miR-1. It is downregulated during disease progression from tumor (4-fold) to metastasis (8-fold, Figure 1B), along with miR-145, miR-378a, miR-143 and miR-497 commonly regulated in both tumor and metastasis samples. Additionally, miR-31, miR-183, miR-135b, miR224 and miR-584 were upregulated with disease progression (Figure 1A, 1B and 1C). All of the miRNAs with fold change were listed in Table 1. miR-1 downregulation is consistent with other studies that showed its downregulation in colorectal cancers 18. Several other miRNAs were expressed at low levels in normal tissue, strongly upregulated in tumors, and continued to be further upregulated in late stage (metastatic) CRC. miR-31 (9.3-fold), miR-183 (7.5-fold), miR-135b (6-fold) and miR-224 (3.6-fold), were all significantly expressed in metastasis in the sequencing data, in agreement with other studies demonstrating the same expression pattern in CRC and other disease states 19-21. Specifically, miR-31 expression in benign samples was negligible and increased significantly with disease progression, this data is similar to previous reports showing increased presence of miR-31 in several cancer types with metastasis 22.
        Once miRNA gene expression was determined, we performed biological pathway analysis, using MetaCore software (previous known as GeneGo; v6.25), to identify candidate “molecular signatures.” Pathway analysis on differentially expressed benign, tumor, and metastasis samples were obtained. As expected, most of the affected miRNAs were involved in cell regulation, cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of colorectal cancer (Figure 2A). Gene ontology (Figure 2B) and disease by biomarkers (Figure 2C) clearly showed that most of the miRNAs were known to be involved in colorectal and/or other cancer types. Regulation and proliferation pathway analysis data of miRNAs in tumor vs benign and metastasis vs benign cancer samples, showed most of the miRs were involved in colon cancer and cellular migration (Figures 3A-3E). We further viewed the network analysis of the miRNAs that were involved in signaling pathways. We observed three major pathways were commonly affected in the tumor and metastasis groups (Figures 3F-3H) and only specific to the metastasis group (Figures 3I-3K).
      
      
        Differentially expressed piRNAs in colorectal cancer tissue samples
        Piwi-interacting RNAs are the largest class of non-coding RNAs 23 recently shown to play important roles in cancer progression. They also represent a third class of small RNA silencers (other two classes are miRNAs and siRNAs) that form RNA-protein complexes by interacting with piwi-proteins. These are required for both epigenetic and post-transcriptional gene silencing of retrotransposons and other genetic elements in germ line cells, particularly during spermatogenesis 24. We remapped aligned small RNA sequenced data with piRBase annotation and identified six piRNAs (including two piRNAs with alternative transcripts) whose expression levels were statistically significant (p<0.05; Figure 4A, and group wise hierarchical clustering with Venn diagram in Figure 4B). Two piRNAs were commonly upregulated in both tumor and metastasis groups. Tumor vs benign group enriched only four piRNAs which piR-hsa-25447 (3-fold), piR-hsa-23992 (3-fold), and piR-hsa-1043 (2.4-fold) were upregulated and the remaining one downregulated [piR-hsa-28876 (2.3-fold)]. In the metastasis vs benign group, 27 piRNAs were enriched (with multiple transcripts) of which 22 were upregulated [Top five: piR-hsa-22842 (22-fold), piR-hsa-23317 (9.5-fold), piR-hsa-26131 (6-fold) piR-hsa-23210.1 (6-fold) and piR-hsa-25447 (5.7-fold) and the remaining five downregulated [piR-hsa-27729 (3.4-fold), piR-hsa-7193.1 (3.4-fold), piR-hsa-7193.2 (3.2-fold) piR-hsa-27729.1 (3-fold) and piR-hsa-27730.1 (2.4-fold)] (All piRNAs were listed in the Table 2). Recently, more attention is being focused on piRNAs in relation to biologic functions and epigenetic involvement of the biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic use, which still remains largely unknown. Although piRNA detection in cancer correlates with poorer clinical outcomes suggesting a functional role 25, data available so far is not sufficient to entirely discriminate between a 'passenger' role for the ectopic expression versus a 'driver' role in the pathogenesis of these diseases 25. Cancer associated piRNAs are especially upregulated in breast cancer (piR-4987, piR-20365, piR-20485, piR-20582 and piR-932) 26, 27, and gastric cancer (piR-823 and piR651) 28, 29. In kidney cancer both upregulated piRNAs (piR-32051, piR-39894, piR-43607) and down-regulated piRNAs (piR-38756, piR-57125, piR-30924) 30 have been identified. piRNA down-regulation has also been observed in pancreatic cancer (piR-017061) 31, multiple myeloma (piR-823), and lung cancer (piR-L-163) 32.
      
      
        Differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs in colorectal cancer tissue samples
        Long non-coding RNAs, larger than 200 nucleotides 24, are the most recent and least characterized ncRNAs. lncRNAs have tissue-specific expression and are expressed in a regulated manner correlating with distinct gene sets that influence cell function 33. They are also expressed as both tumor suppressors and promoters 34-36. Our small RNA sequencing data was remapped to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs in colorectal cancer samples. It revealed 18 lncRNAs in tumor vs benign, 89 in metastasis vs benign, and 15 in metastasis vs tumor groups being significantly expressed (p<0.05). The top upregulated ones being lnc-SLC47A1-3:1, lnc-RABGGTB-1:6, lnc-RPL17-2:4 and lnc-HHIPL1-3:1 (Figure 5A); and the top downregulated lncRNAs being lnc-ABHD3-1:4, lnc-ABHD3-1:2, lnc-ZNF860-1:1 and lnc-PCYOX1L-2:15 (Figure 5B). Stage wise hierarchical clustering with Venn diagram for both tumor and metastasis groups is illustrated in Figure 5C along with differential expressed lncRNAs listed in the Table 3. lncRNAs are a heterogeneous group of transcripts, with diverse mechanisms and differential expression in many diseases including tumors 35. ABHD3 is an alpha/beta hydrolase protein found in a wide range of enzyme domains whose function remains unknown, and multiple transcripts of this gene were downregulated in tumor and metastasis samples in this study. Further exploration is needed to assess their function in cancer and other diseases.
      
      
        Differentially expressed sn/snoRNAs, mt_rRNA, miscRNA, nonsense mediated decay and rRNAs in colorectal cancer tissue samples
        Small nuclear RNAs, form a class of RNA molecules that localize within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells 24. Their primary function is pre-mRNA processing, for which they are always associated with a set of specific proteins and the complexes are referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). A subclass of snRNAs called small nucleolar RNAs that localize to the nucleolus are implicated in the maturation of ribosomal and transfer RNA molecules by specific chemical modifications 24. We remapped the aligned reads to the GenCode database, which contains most of the curated small RNAs. We specifically looked at sn/snoRNAs, mt_rRNA, misc_RNA, nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and rRNAs. All the mentioned sncRNAs were significantly upregulated during CRC disease progression (Figure 6A, and stage wise hierarchical clustering with Venn diagram in Figure 6C). In our investigation, nine differential expression genes were noted in the tumor vs benign group, 104 in metastasis vs benign (with multiple transcripts), and 15 in metastasis vs tumor group. This sncRNA cohort included all sn/snoRNAs, mt_rRNA, misc_RNA, NMD and rRNAs, with most belonging to sn/snoRNAs (listed in the Table 4). Increased expression was noted during metastasis, suggesting potential biomarker use in late stage cancers. Previous studies have shown the RNU family of snRNAs to be expressed in pancreatic, colorectal and lung cancers 37 and decreasing after tumor removal by surgery. Recent studies have also shown that the SNHG (small nucleolar RNA host genes) family of snoRNAs plays a crucial role in cancer. For example, Zhang et al., showed upregulation of SNHG1 in hepatocellular carcinoma, affecting tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and others 38, while Zhao et al., showed downregulation of SNHG5 in gastric cancer 39. Conversely, in our study, SNHG12 (two transcripts, 4.2-fold) and SNHG1 (3.4-fold) increased. Other snoRNAs, i.e., snoRD14 (5-fold), snoRD15B (5-fold), snoRD32A (4.7-fold) were only upregulated in the metastasis stage (Table 4). Further validation of identified snRNAs are needed to confirm their biological functions and possible use as biomarkers.
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      High-throughput sequencing technologies have effectively delineated the crucial roles of non-coding RNAs in normal cellular biology and cancer progression. We have identified several small non-coding RNAs which may be involved in the stepwise progression of normal colon tissue to cancer and subsequent metastatic disease. However, their functions are still relatively unknown. Our analysis can provide a comprehensive list of the miRNAs, piRNAs, lncRNAs and sn/snoRNAs specific to each stage with the commonly expressed genes listed in Tables 1-4. Further understanding and validating will allow us to link these distinct small RNAs with the phenotypic traits seen in the evolution of colorectal cancer, thereby offering a potential for biomarker development. Likewise, further understanding of their roles in cancer signaling pathways may represent a novel target for treatment. Detailed analysis of the individual transcriptome can personalize both prognosis and intervention strategies in colorectal cancer.
    
  
        High grade gliomas contribute to most brain tumor mortality. A few studies reported that the immune system affected glioma development, and immune biomarkers helped understand the disease and formulate effective immunotherapy for patients. Currently, no B lymphocyte-based prognostic signature was reported in gliomas. By applying 78 B cell lineage-specific genes, we conducted a whole-genome gene expression analysis in 782 high grade gliomas derived from three independent datasets by Cox regression analysis and risk score method for signature identification, and then used Gene Ontology, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and other statistical methods for functional annotations of the signature-defined differences. We developed a five B cell-associated gene signature for prognosis of high grade glioma patients, which is independent of clinicopathological and genetic features. The signature identified high risk patients suitable for chemoradiotherapy, whereas low risk patients should rule out chemotherapy with radiotherapy only. We found that tumors of TCGA Mesenchymal subtype and wild type IDH1 were preferentially stratified to the high risk group, which bore strong immunosuppressive microenvironment, while tumors of TCGA Proneural subtype and mutated IDH1 were significantly accumulated to the low risk group, which exhibited less immunosuppressive state. The five B cell-associated gene signature predicts poor survival of high risk patients bearing strong immunosuppression and helps select optimal therapeutic regimens for glioma patients.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor and has inevitable local recurrence, thus contributing to a considerable brain tumor-related mortality in adults and children. High grade gliomas (HGGs) (World Health Organization WHO grade III and grade IV) consist of glioblastoma (GBM) (WHO grade IV) and anaplastic gliomas (WHO grade III) including anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA) [1, 2]. The standard therapy for the disease includes surgery, radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy (CT), and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) [3]. Despite the improvements in these therapies, the median survival of the patients with GBM and anaplastic gliomas is only 15 months and three years respectively [4]. Moreover, highly variable prognosis exists in HGGs such as 3–5% of GBM patients surviving longer than three years, thus hindering precise patient stratification and treatment [5]. This is mainly because of a heterogeneous population of the HGG tumors and their variable microenvironments, which affect tumor progression and patient survival [6].
      Tumor-infiltrating immune cells have been recognized as an essential factor for clinical outcomes of cancer patients [7]. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration has been found to be associated with favorable outcomes in many cancer types such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioma, esophageal and rectal cancer [8–11]. However, the tumor-infiltrating immune cells are frequently modulated by the local cellular and soluble components of the tumor microenvironment, resulting in the generation of inhibitory immune cells. Immunosuppressive T regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and tumor-associated M2 macrophages are commonly present in the tumor mass, which create the immunosuppressive microenvironment and support tumor growth and progression [12]. Therefore, the intra- and peritumoral presences of immune infiltrates significantly impact patient survival [13].
      B lymphocyte is recently recognized to participate in regulating immune response to murine and human tumors. A subset of B cells, regulatory B cells (Breg), plays an immunosuppressive role in carcinogenesis and becomes a therapeutic target in solid tumors [14, 15]. Some findings also indicate that B cell-mediated immune response or associated tumoral tertiary lymphoid structure is favorable for patient survival in NSCLC and hepatocellular carcinoma [16, 17]. At present, few studies explore the role of tumor-infiltrating B cells in malignant glioma and their impact in clinical outcomes of the patients remains unknown.
      In the study, we applied whole-genome mRNA expression profiles of gliomas and a set of 78 B cell lineage-specific genes to identify a B cell-specific signature for clinical outcomes of HGG patients. We found a five B cell lineage-specific gene signature (four risky genes of BACE2, FCGR2B, ISG20, and SWAP70 and one protective gene of QRSL1), which successfully stratified HGG patients into a high risk group with poorer survival and a low risk group with better outcomes and helped select optimal adjuvant therapies for HGG patients. The findings support the possibility that treatment strategies targeting HGG-infiltrating immunomodulatory cells are therapeutically beneficial.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Identification of a five B cell-associated gene signature for prognosis in high grade gliomas independent of clinicopathological and genetic features
        To identify a B cell-associated gene prognostic signature in gliomas, we first assessed expression patterns of 78 B cell lineage-specific genes among glioma grades by Student's t test and then calculated prognostic values of differentially expressed genes by univariate Cox regression analysis using gene expression profiles of GSE16011 dataset as a training set. Five differentially expressed B cell-specific genes were identified to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS) of HGG patients (P < 0.001, Table 1). The five significant genes were classified into two types of genes: risky and protective genes. Risky and protective genes were defined as ones that had hazard ratios for death greater and less than 1 respectively. Using this definition, we found four risky genes (BACE2, FCGR2B, ISG20, and SWAP70) and one protective gene (QRSL1). To test the predictive power of the five genes as a signature, we developed a risk score formula by using a linear combination of the expression levels of the five genes weighted with their regression coefficients as described in Methods. The risk score for each patient was then calculated in grade II, III, IV, and HGG gliomas. Using the median risk score as the cutoff value, the patients were successfully divided into a high risk group and a low risk group in each grade (Figure 1A–1C, Supplementary Figure S1A). The patients with the high risk score had a shorter median OS than ones with the low risk score especially in HGGs (p < 0.001) (Figure 2A and 2B). Hierarchical clustering of the five gene expression in HGG tumors showed that tumors of high risk patients expressed high levels of the risky genes and a low level of the protective gene (Figure 2C) (p < 0.001). Also the risk gene expression increased and the protective gene expression decreased with increased malignancy of gliomas consistent in the three datasets (Supplementary Figure S2).

            Patients in the low risk group showed a better survival than those in the high risk group according to the signature risk score in GSE16011 dataset (A–C), TCGA dataset D–F), and Rembrandt dataset (G–I). L, low risk group; H, high risk group; III, WHO grade III; IV, WHO grade IV; HGGs, high grade gliomas.

        We then determined the dependence of the signature of clinicopathological and molecular parameters in HGG patients from GSE16011 dataset by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. All the parameters (Table 2) were selected based on our clinical experience that were related to prognosis. We found that the signature (risk score), age, preoperative KPS score, IDH1 status, and histology were statistically associated with OS (p < 0.01) (Table 3). Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the signature was an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.018) after adjusted for age, preoperative KPS score, and histology (Table 3).

        Currently, there are few reports related to the five genes in the field of Neuro-oncology. BACE2, a member of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme family of genes, encodes an integral membrane glycoprotein that functions as an aspartic protease related to Alzheimer's disease [18]. FCGR2B (CD32B)-encoded protein is a member of Fc receptor common γ chain (FcRγ) family containing an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which is a low affinity receptor for the Fc region of IgGs and down-regulates the antibody production by B cells. It is a promising therapeutic target for malignancies [19, 20]. ISG20 encodes an exoribonuclease that acts on a single-stranded RNA, exhibits an antiviral activity against RNA viruses in an exonuclease-dependent manner, and probably plays accessory roles in the maturation of snRNAs and rRNAs [21]. SWAP70-encoded protein specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate, transduces signals from tyrosine kinase receptors to RAC-protein kinase B (RAC/PKB), and regulates signaling of membrane ruffling. Studies have shown that SWAP70 is involved in signaling B cell activation and may have a potential oncogenic function in cancer [22–24]. QRSL1-encoded protein allows the formation of correctly charged Glu-tRNA through the transamidation of misacylated Glu-tRNA (Gln) in the mitochondria in the presence of glutamine and ATP through an activated gamma-phosphor-Glu-tRNA [25].
      
      
        Validation of the B cell-associated gene prognostic signature in two independent HGG platforms
        To validate the prognostic power of the signature, we used two independent glioma mRNA expression profiling datasets from Rembrandt and TCGA RNAseq databases. In 242 HGGs of 311 glioma cases from REMBRANDT and 330 HGGs of 502 glioma cases from TCGA, we applied the same risk score formula developed in the training set to calculate the risk score for each patient and accordingly divided the patients into the low and high risk groups in line with the risk score using the same cutoff. Similarly as in the training set, the patients were successfully stratified into the high and low risk groups with the high risk patients having a shorter OS (p < 0.001) (Figure 1D–1I, Supplementary Figure S1B and S1C, Figure 2A and 2B) and expressing the high levels of the risky genes and the low level of the protective gene (Figure 2C) (p < 0.001).
      
      
        The B cell-associated gene signature assisted predicting the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy for low and high risk HGG patients
        To determine whether the signature assists predicting the efficacy of the postoperative RT and CT in HGG patients, we extracted the therapeutic information available for 175 HGG patients in GSE16011 dataset. According to their risk scores calculated using the signature, 89 patients (76 patients underwent RT and 13 patients underwent CRT) were stratified to the high risk group and the other 86 patients (75 patients underwent RT and 11 patients underwent CRT) to the low risk group. We then compared the survival advantage between RT and CRT by Kaplan-Meier plotting in each group. We found that OS did not differ significantly between RT and CRT in the low risk group (p > 0.05), that is, the addition of CT to RT did not improve OS of HGG patients with the low risk scores, but the benefit of CRT was observed in the high risk group with significantly improved OS (p < 0.05) (Figure 3A–3C).

            (A, D) HGG patients in GSE 16011 and GBM patients in TCGA treated with CRT showed a better prognosis than those with RT alone. (B, E) Benefit of CT was observed in the high risk group with significantly improved OS (p < 0.05). (C, F) The addition of CT to RT did not improve OS of patients in the low risk group (p > 0.05).

        We then used 360 GBM patients treated with standard RT with or without temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy in TCGA dataset to confirm the therapeutic predictive value of the signature. Similarly, CRT was only beneficial for the high risk GBM patients (p < 0.001) (33 RT/148 CRT) but not for the low risk GBM patients (p > 0.05) (28 RT/151 CRT) (Figure 3D–3F). The findings suggest that the low risk patients should avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.
      
      
        The signature-stratified low and high risk HGGs exhibited distinct molecular features
        Considering the potential of the signature in predicting clinical therapies, we next assessed the association of the low and high risk groups with some known molecular features of gliomas and related clinical characteristics. We found that tumors with high risk scores included almost all TCGA Mesenchymal subtype tumors and wild-type IDH1, whereas tumors with low risk scores contained most of TCGA Proneural subtype tumors and IDH1 mutation consistently in the three datasets of GSE16011, TCGA, and REMBRANDT (P < 0.001) (Figure 4A, Figure 5A–5H). However, the signature stratified TCGA Classical and Neural subtype tumors, as well as grade III and IV tumors described earlier (Figure 1), into the low and high risk groups (Figure 4A), patients of which showed differential survival advantages (Supplementary Figure S3) in TCGA dataset.

            (A) Tumors with high risk scores contained almost all TCGA Mesenchymal subtype and wild-type IDH1, and tumors with low risk scores included most of TCGA Proneural subtype and mutated IDH1.

        The high risk HGGs exhibited enhanced expression of immunosuppressive factors and regulatory immune cells
        The notable differences in the two risk groups of HGGs led us to further conduct a whole-genome gene expression analysis by SAM method using the same three datasets to obtain a broader biological insight between the two groups. After 1000 times of permutation test, those genes with FDR < 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed between the two groups, which exhibited a good separation from the low to high risk score shown by one-dimensional hierarchical clustering analysis (Figure 4B). By screening top 1000 increased expression genes and 1000 decreased expression genes in the three datasets, the overlapped genes (416 genes with increased expression and 368 genes with decreased expression) in the high risk group (Supplementary Table S1B and S1C) were chosen for further analysis. The positively correlated genes (pink marked genes in Figure 4B) were used for GO analysis. The top 15 GO terms indicated that these genes were mainly related to immune response such as defense response, inflammatory response, positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade, leukocyte-mediated immunity, and response to hypoxia and oxygen levels (Figure 6A).

        HGG patients generally have poor immune response. To further decipher the association of the immunological state with HGGs, we specifically analyzed immunosuppressive gene expression between the low and high risk groups in TCGA dataset. Immunosuppressive factor genes (IL10, TGFβ1, CD274 (protein name PDL1) and FASLG (FASL)) were significantly increased in the high risk group compared with the low risk group (Figure 6B). Marker genes of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) (ITGAM (CD11b), CD14, FUT4 (CD15), CD33) [26] and M2 microglia/macrophages (CD68, CD163, MSR1 (CD204) and MRC1 (CD206)) [27, 28] were significantly up-regulated in the high risk group compared with the low risk group (Figure 6C and 6D). Similarly, the expressions of Treg marker genes (CD4, ICOS, IDO1, FoxP3, IL2RA (CD25)) [29] were elevated in the high risk group (Figure 6E). In addition, we also observed the similar expression patterns of the immunosuppressive factors and cell markers in the other two datasets of GSE16011 and Rembrandt (Supplementary Figure S4). GSEA analyses of the three datasets further indicated that the high risk group had increased expression of genes (Supplementary Table S1D) that inhibit the activation of memory CD8+ T cells and their differentiation to cytotoxic CD8+ effector T cells (Figure 6G–6I).
        Taken together, the findings demonstrated that strong immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributed to the worse malignancy of the tumors and eventually poorer survival of the patients stratified in the high risk group.
      
    
    
      DISCUSSION
      A growing body of evidences has supported the interaction between the immune system and glioma pathogenesis [30, 31]. A few prognostic immune signatures related to T cell, NK cell, and microglia/macrophage have been reported for gliomas [32, 33], but no B cell-associated signature was studied in the disease. Here, by using a risk score method we identified and validated a signature composed of five B cell associated genes based on the three independent genome-wide gene expression datasets. The signature successfully divides glioma patients especially high grade glioma patients into the low risk group with favorable OS and the high risk group with poor survival, consistently the latter exhibiting significantly strong immunosuppressive microenvironment in their tumors. The signature also shows that the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy improves OS of the high risk patients, but not that of the low risk ones after surgery. These findings aid in better understanding of the interplay between immune response and glioma progression.
      The immune responsive microenvironment of tumors contributes to an antitumor activity while the immune suppressive state promotes tumor development [34]. In our study, we have found that the major differences of the low and high risk groups of the HGG patients are related to immune response such as inflammatory response and leukocyte-mediated immunity. Because the microenvironment of GBM is highly immunosuppressive [35], we have then analyzed the gene expression patterns of the two risk groups and found that the high risk group exhibits significantly increased expression of classical immunosuppressive factors such as IL10, TGF-β, PDL1, and FASL and many immunosuppressive cell markers related to immunosuppressive cells such as tumor-associated macrophage M2, Tregs, and MDSC. The presence of immunosuppressive factors such as IL-10 and TGF-β and inhibitory molecules on the GBM cell surface were reported to inhibit the antitumor activities of T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes [35]. FASL was expressed in human malignant glioma cells and induced apoptosis of T lymphocytes [36]. Astrocytoma cell lines expressed PDL1, which inhibited T cell functions such as proliferation and cytotoxicity and promoted apoptosis [37]. In addition, the presence of immunosuppressive infiltrates such as FoxP3+ Treg cells, M2 macrophages, and MDSC were documented in gliomas and associated with poor survival in gliomas [38, 39]. These studies support our findings that tumors of the five B cell-associated gene signature-stratified high risk group are more immune suppressive compared with those of the low risk group, thus creating a more favorable microenvironment for glioma progression.
      Accurate classification of tumors is important for appropriate treatment selection. Nevertheless, no single genetic alteration could elucidate the complicated pathogenesis of HGGs, leading to the difficulty in choosing appropriate therapeutic strategies for HGG patients. In the study, we found that the addition of CT to RT did not improve OS of patients in the low risk group compared to the benefit of CRT in the high risk group with significantly improved OS. Accumulated evidence indicates that RT and CT potentiate an antitumor activity in esophageal and rectal cancer via activating immune response through increased tumor antigen exposure by CT-induced immunogenic tumor cell death and released proinflammatory cytokines to activate T effector cell response [40, 41]. In addition, preclinical studies have demonstrated that the density of CD4+ and CD8+TILs is positively associated with good response after RT, CT and CRT [42]. Furthermore, basic studies of breast and prostate cancer suggest that RT or CT may be more sufficient in immunocompetent mice than immunosuppressive ones [43, 44]. We have found that the addition of CT to RT can not significantly improve OS in the low risk group. This is probably because of good immune responsive state of those patients and thus having good response to RT, in other words, RT only is sufficient to generate the same therapeutic effect as CRT, meanwhile avoiding the toxicity of adjuvant CT. However, we have found that the addition of CT generates the better outcomes for the high risk patients with strong immunosuppression. This is most likely because CT-induced myelosuppression and lymphopenia effectively deplete immunosuppressive cells such as Treg cells and thus eliminate the immune tolerance to autologous tumor antigens [45–47] in the group of patients. Such lymphodepletion induces reactive homeostatic proliferation and generates more active immune response to tumor antigens from CRT-caused tumor cell death [48, 49], leading to significantly improved OS of this group of patients. Therefore, the signature can identify glioma patients with a poor survival who may take advantage of adjuvant CT and patients with a favorable survival who should avoid the CT treatment.
      More than 70% of gliomas carry the mutation of IDH1 (R132H), which occurs in the critical arginine residue (Arg, R) in the catalytic pocket to histidine (His, H) [50]. Recent studies have shown that IDH1 (R132H) represents an immunogenic tumor antigen recognized by CD4+IFN-γ-producing T cells in patients [51]. In our study, the IDH1 (R132H) mutation was preferentially found in the low risk group with the more immune responsive state. Basic studies showed that an IDH1 (R132H) vaccine induced a specific antitumor immune response against IDH1 (R132H)-mutated tumors and the antitumor effect was associated with CD19+B cells through their antigen presentation capacity in an MHC-humanized mice model [52]. Coincidently, we have found that the high expression of FCRG2B (CD32B), the inhibitor of antigen presentation and antibody production by B cells, occurs in the high risk group, which was opposite with the preferential occurrence of IDH1 mutation in the low risk group. Our previous study showed that the plasma of patients of low grade tumors contained a higher level of IgG autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigen IGFBP2 than that of high grade tumor patients [53].
      The molecular heterogeneity of gliomas especially GBM has been widely recognized. Four molecular subtypes (Proneural, Neural, Classical, and Mesenchymal) were identified and adopted by TCGA [54]. The correlation between these subtypes with the immune system has attracted increased attention because of increasingly recognized roles of the immune system in etiology and developing new immunotherapy in gliomas. Previous studies showed the existence of different immunological states between Proneural and Mesenchymal subtypes [55], and an immune prognostic signature was reported for GBM patients especially for ones with the Proneural subtype [56]. We have found that the patients with the lower risk score are preferentially associated with the Proneural subtype and exhibit a significantly better prognosis, and the patients with the higher risk score show the Mesenchymal preference and poor survival, which are consistent with the previous report showing that Mesenchymal gliomas with immune suppressive nature were more aggressive and led to poor patient survival [57].
      The role of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) in gliomas remains poorly understood. Some studies reported B cell infiltration in gliomas [58, 59]. Engler et al. found that microglia/macrophage-related genes were significantly enriched in the Mesenchymal subtype compared to the non-Mesenchymal ones, but the B cell gene signature was not enriched to the significance between the two groups [59], which is likely due to impaired normalized enrichment score of the B cell gene set signature when the whole B cell-specific gene set including ones not directly associated with the disease is incorporated in the enrichment analysis. In other cancer types such as breast cancer and NSCLC, TIL-Bs can act as antigen presenting cells (APCs) for a variety of tumor antigens and interplay with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for increased survival [60, 61]. In a GBM mouse model, B cells act as APCs for T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and tumor regression [62]. However, the role of B cells in tumor immunity has remained controversial. Other reports demonstrated that TIL-Bs suppressed immune response in some tumor types such as lymphoma, colon cancer, melanoma, and skin carcinoma [63, 64]. In the study, we have found that the risky gene FCGR2B is highly expressed in tumors of the high risk group, which was reported to play the immunosuppressive role, although the functions of other four signature genes in the immune system remain to be explored. Therefore, based on our findings, FCGR2B could be a target for immune checkpoint inhibition to improve antitumor response of immunotherapy for glioma patients.
      In summary, our study has provided a clear view that the immune system such as the B lymphocyte interplays with gliomas and thus influences the prognosis of HGG patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify a signature composed of the B cell-associated genes, which reveals different immunological states of glioma tumors of the low and high risk patients. The signature can help stratify HGG patients for optimal treatment strategies.
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Databases and B cell lineage-specific genes used in the study
        Whole-genome mRNA expression microarray data and clinical information (including age at diagnosis, gender, preoperative Karnofsky Performance score (KPS), histology, postoperative radiotherapy with or without adjuvant CT, and isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (IDH1) gene mutation status) were obtained from GSE16011 database as a training set (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16011), and the validation datasets include The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (mRNA and RNAseq data) (http://cancergenome.nih.gov) and Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasis Data (REMBRANDT) (http://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/rembrandt). The RNAseq data were log2 transformed before analysis. A set of 78 B cell lineage-specific genes (Supplementary Table S1A) was adopted from a previous study [30].
      
      
        Statistical analysis and signature identification and validation
        Patients alive for more than 90 days were eligible for the study because too short survival was more likely resulted from severe complication rather than glioma occurrence. In 232 glioma samples from GSE16011 dataset, there were 22 grade II tumors, 78 grade III tumors (including AA, AO, and AOA), and 132 GBMs. OS was calculated as the interval from the day of first surgery to death or the end of follow-up. Firstly, an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used to discriminate the expression level of each gene in the B cell lineage-specific gene set between each two of II-IV grade tumors. Secondly, the prognostic value of the differentially expressed gene (higher or lower than the median expression level) was calculated by the univariate Cox regression analysis with log-rank test by packages (survival) of R to get the corresponding Hazard Ratio (HR) and p value in four groups (grade II, III, IV, and HGG). Then the differentially expressed genes with significant prognostic value (p < 0.05) were selected after screened by the two steps. As a result, we identified five B cell-associated genes, which were then used to form a signature for prediction assessment and further validation in other two datasets (TCGA and REMBRANDT).
        To test the power of the five gene signature for predicting clinical outcomes, a risk score formula for survival prediction was constructed according to a linear combination of the mRNA expression level of the five genes and weighted by the regression coefficient from the univariate Cox regression analyses (β) [65]. Based on the five gene signature, the risk score for each patient was calculated as follows:
        Risk score = expr gene1 × βgene1 +expr gene2 × βgene2+… + expr gene5 × βgene5
        According to this model, patients having high risk scores were expected to have poor OS. Patients of each grade in the training set were stratified into a high or low risk group by using the 50th percentile risk score as the cut off. Considering genes with multiple probes in the microarray settings, we chose the probe having a larger standard deviation (SD) and smaller β value, which is more likely to have a prognostic value with less likely to have a bias. This is a widely accepted method to filter genes with multiple probes by applying SD or median absolute deviation (MAD) [54]. We used the same β in the validation sets. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to discriminate overall survival by using the Mantel log-rank to assess the statistical significance between different groups with GraphPad Prism 6.0 statistical software.
        To further annotate the biological insight of the high and low risk groups stratified by the signature, the differently expressed genes of HGGs were identified by significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Those genes with increased expression in tumors of high risk patients were used for Gene Ontology (GO) analysis in DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was downloaded from the Broad Institute (www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) for functional annotation. Heat maps of different grades of gliomas were constructed by Gene Cluster 3.0 and Gene Tree View software. The χ2 test was applied for statistical analysis of the correlation for two independent variables. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard method; all the variables chosen were based on our clinical experience, which are related to prognosis. A two-sided p value of < 0.05 was regarded as significant.

        The detailed molecular mechanisms and safety issues of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) usage in bone graft substitution remain poorly understood. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of rhBMP-2 in gastric cancer cells, we used microarrays to determine the gene expression patterns related to the effects of rhBMP-2. Based on a gene ontology analysis, several genes were upregulated during the regulation of the cell cycle and BMP signaling pathway. MYC was found to be significantly decreased along with its downstream target genes, the aurora kinases (AURKs), by rhBMP-2 in the network analysis. We further confirmed this finding with western blot data that rhBMP-2 inhibited c-Myc, AURKs, and β-catenin in SNU484 and SNU638 cells. An AURK inhibitor significantly decreased c-Myc expression in gastric cancer cells. Combination treatment with rhBMP-2 and AURK inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased c-Myc expression compared with gastric cancer cells treated with an rhBMP-2 or AURK inhibitor, respectively. Similar effects for decreased c-Myc expression were observed when we silenced β-catenin in gastric cancer cells. These results indicate that rhBMP-2 attenuated the growth of gastric cancer cells via the inactivation of β-catenin via c-Myc and AURKs. Therefore, our findings suggest that rhBMP-2 could be safely used with patients who undergo gastric or gastroesophageal cancer surgery.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      Gastric cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer worldwide and ranks second in cancer mortality [1]. Growing evidence shows that the incidence of gastric cancer has decreased, but the mortality rate has steadily increased over the past decades because it often presents at an advanced stage with an overall survival of about 10 months [2–5]. The most effective curative treatment for gastric cancer is surgery, with chemotherapy and radiation therapy most commonly recommended after surgery [5–7]. However, long-term survival after current chemotherapy-based treatments for advanced gastric cancer is disappointing [7–9]. Therefore, innovative therapeutic approaches must be explored to improve clinical outcomes for gastric cancer patients.
      Current approaches for reconstructive techniques include tissue engineering [10]. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 is commonly used in bone graft substitutions, including for bone fracture and spinal surgery [11]. Moreover, rhBMP-2 enhances osteoinductive factors and improves bone therapy [11–13]. However, the use of rhBMP-2 in the area of a resected tumor or in patients undergoing treatment for malignancy is limited due to the unknown effects of BMP-2 on malignancies and other contraindications [14–16]. Moreover, the function of BMP-2 raises the possibility of cancer promotion since BMP-2 and its receptors are highly expressed in many human cancers [17]. For instance, Kokorina et al. reported that rhBMP-2 treatment induces cancer cell growth and tumor cell invasion [10, 14, 18]. In addition, a study that evaluated the association between rhBMP-2 and malignancy by reviewing 515 articles [19] found that 43 studies indicated that BMP-2 enhances cancer growth. However, 18 studies found that BMP-2 suppresses cancer proliferation [19]. Our recent publications have found evidence of an antitumor effect of BMP-2 in esophageal cancer cells through the activation of the hippo signaling pathway [20] and that rhBMP-2 has an anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer cell lines [21]. Thus, the use of rhBMP-2 raises safety issues regarding cancer risk, but data on the effect of exogenous BMP-2 on cancer are conflicting. Further studies on BMP-2 and cancer are required.
      There have been no reports of a correlation between rhBMP-2 effects and human gastric cancer cells or the use of rhBMP-2 for reconstructive surgery on bone defects by cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate gene expression related to the mechanisms of rhBMP-2 in human gastric cancer cells. We demonstrated that rhBMP-2 significantly inhibited gastric cell viability, and the effects were mediated by suppressing the expression of β-catenin, c-Myc, and AURKs. These results indicated that rhBMP-2 suppresses activation of the Wnt signaling pathway via c-Myc and AURKs, which may, in part, induce cell death of the gastric cancer cells.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Effects of rhBMP-2 on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells
        To investigate the effects of rhBMP-2 on gastric cancer cell proliferation, MTT assays were performed on SNU484 and SNU638 cells. The viability of the SNU484 and SNU638 cells was significantly inhibited following rhBMP-2 treatment in a dose-dependent manner compared with the non-treatment group (Figure 1A). In the SNU484 cell line, inhibition of cell viability with treatment compared to the control group was 81.21% ± 8.50% (P = 0.058) with 10 nM, 62.72% ± 5.31% (P = 0.002) with 250 nM, 45.15% ± 4.91% (P = 0.000) with 500 nM, and 36.95% ± 0.24% (P = 0.000) with 1000 nM BMP-2. In the SNU638 cell line, treatment with same doses of rhBMP-2 resulted in 87.13% ± 4.36% (P = 0.100), 69.01% ± 5.86% (P = 0.029), 49.71% ± 4.15% (P = 0.009), and 34.00 ± 2.97% (P = 0.004), respectively for the inhibition of cell viability compared to the controls. These results demonstrated that rhBMP-2 exhibited significant cytotoxicity on the gastric cancer cells.

            A. RhBMP-2 inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. B. Consistent with MTT assays, significantly fewer colonies were formed compared with the control cancer cells in the presence of 1 μM rhBMP-2 after 30 days. Values represent the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments with triplicate plates. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. untreated cells.
          
          
        
      
      
        Effects of rhBMP-2 on SNU484 and SNU638 colony formation
        Colony formation assays analyzed with the anchorage-independent growth of SNU484 and SNU638 cells in semisolid medium. A significant decrease was observed for the number of colonies of SNU484 and SNU638 cells compared with the control cancer cells after four weeks in the presence of 1 μM rhBMP-2 (Figure 1B). Therefore, RhBMP-2 effectively inhibited the colony formation of gastric cancer cells. These findings confirmed that BMP-2 significantly inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation by soft agar colony formation assays.
      
      
        Effects of BMP-2 on p-Smad1/5/8 expression
        We next investigated whether rhBMP-2 increased bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) I, BMPRII, and p-Smad1/5/8 proteins. Expression of rhBMP-2 protein significantly increased following treatment with rhBMP-2 (Figure 2A). To address whether the treatment with rhBMP-2 in gastric cancer cells could increase the level of endogenous BMP-2 expression, we performed real-time RT-PCR to measure the endogenous BMP-2 expression following treatment with rhBMP-2 in SNU484 and SNU638 cells. We found that rhBMP-2 significantly increased BMP-2 mRNA levels in SNU484 and SNU638 cells (Figure 2B). RhBMP-2 increased both the mRNA and protein levels of BMP-2 in gastric cancer cells, which is in line with the microarray analysis of the activation of the BMP-2 signaling pathway. We measured ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 expression following treatment of rhBMP-2 in gastric cancer cells. RhBMP-2 suppressed p-ERK1/2 expression in SNU484 and SNU638 cells at 48 h following treatment of rhBMP-2, while ERK1/2 expression remained unchanged (Supplementary Figure S1). The BMPRII protein levels increased and p-Smad1/5/8 protein expression was significantly increased following rhBMP-2 treatment of SNU484 and SNU638 cells. Therefore, rhBMP-2 appeared to stimulate the activation of BMPRII, which stimulated the expression of p-Smad1/5/8 proteins in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, Smad signaling was induced by the rhBMP-2 treatment.

            A. BMPRI, BMPRII, and p-Smad1/5/8 were measured by western blots of SNU484 and SNU638 cells after treatment with rhBMP-2 for 72 h and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.

        Effects of rhBMP-2 on gene expression profiling
        To test whether the regulation of gene expression mediated the BMP-induced human gastric cancer cell death, microarrays were used to identify gene expression patterns using an Illumina bead array platform. The data showed that more than 1453 genes were regulated by BMP-2 treatment. Specifically, the expression of 826 genes was significantly upregulated, and 609 genes were significantly downregulated after the treatment of SNU484 cells with rhBMP-2 (Figure 3A). Gene ontology (GO) and canonical pathway analysis to determine the biological characteristics of selected genes revealed that cell cycle regulation, the mitotic roles of polo-like kinase, G2/M damage checkpoint regulation, and the BMP signaling pathway were controlled by treatment with rhBMP-2 (Figure 3B). To evaluate the association between BMP-2 treatment and signaling pathway associations, a further gene-network analysis was performed using Ingenuity™ Pathway Analysis. We found that more than 20 networks were enriched for cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation, cell death, and survival. Furthermore, an upstream analysis of the network revealed that the BMP2 signaling pathway was highly activated as shown by BMP-2 downstream target genes BMPRA, BMPR2, CTSK, ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4, HES5, HEY1, SMAD6, SMAD7, and SMAD9 (Figure 3C and 3D). MYC signaling was significantly downregulated after treatment with rhBMP-2 as shown by the downstream target genes AURKB, CCNA2, CCNB2, CDC20, CDC25B, CDK1, CDK2, EZH2, and FOXM1 (Figure 3C and 3D). Therefore, MYC may be the core gene responsible for regulating many downstream genes following rhBMP-2 treatment.

        Effect of rhBMP-2 on Myc signaling on gastric cancer cells
        To determine whether BMP-2 expression was inversely correlated with MYC expression, we further investigated c-Myc expression that was decreased by rhBMP treatment in the microarrays using RT-PCR and western blot. RT-PCR revealed that 1 μM rhBMP-2 treatment significantly decreased c-Myc mRNA levels (Figure 4A). Additionally, treatment with rhBMP-2 significantly attenuated c-Myc protein expression (Figure 4B). These data suggest that rhBMP-2 inhibits c-Myc expression in gastric cancer cells. These observations are in agreement with the microarray data, suggesting that rhBMP-2 may suppress the expression of c-Myc in gastric cancer cells.

        Cell cycle regulatory protein expression by rhBMP-2
        The microarray data revealed that the regulation of the cell cycle was induced by rhBMP-2 treatment. To determine the involvement of rhBMP-2 in cell cycle regulation, we determined the cell cycle distribution using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cell cycle fractions were measured at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment of the SNU484 cells with rhBMP-2. The population in the G1 phase of the cell cycle significantly and time-dependently increased (Figure 5A). Since BMP-2 induced G1 cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells, we tested the cells for alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins (e.g., p21 and p53) after treatment with rhBMP-2. We found that p53 protein levels increased at 12 h and continued increasing until 72 h. Protein levels of p21 we also increased at 24 h after rhBMP-2 treatment and gradually increased until 72 h. These results suggest that rhBMP-2 induced cell cycle arrest and thus, inhibited gastric cell proliferation.

        Effect of rhBMP-2 on AURKA and AURKB signaling in gastric cancer cells
        We next determined the expression of aurora kinase A (AURKA) and aurora kinase B (AURKB), which are downstream target genes of Myc. We found that both target genes were decreased by rhBMP treatment in the microarray experiments. Treatment with rhBMP-2 significantly decreased the mRNA levels of AURKA and AURKB in SNU 484 cells (Figure 6A). RhBMP-2 significantly decreased AURKA mRNA but no significant difference was observed for AURKB after rhBMP-2 treatment of SNU638 cells. In western blots, similar observations were found for both types of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, rhBMP-2 suppressed AURKA and AURKB protein levels in the SNU484 and SNU638 cells (Figure 6B). To further investigate whether rhBMP-2 regulates c-Myc expression mediated through AURK in gastric cancer cells, we used an AURK inhibitor (500 nM) in combination with rhBMP-2 in SNU484 and SNU638 cells. As shown in Figure 6C. AURKA and AURKB were suppressed following treatment with the AURK inhibitor. Moreover, the AURK inhibitor suppressed c-Myc protein expression in the SNU484 and SNU638 cells. In addition, the AURK inhibitor combined with the rhBMP-2 treatment significantly decreased the expression of c-Myc expression levels compared to rhBMP-2 or AURK inhibitor treatment alone in SNU484 and SNU638 cells. These results indicate that the rhBMP-2-induced decrease in c-Myc expression was mediated by AURK in gastric cancer cells.

        Effect of rhBMP-2 on β-catenin signaling in SNU484 and SNU638 cells
        The β-catenin signaling pathway is important for cancer progression, and the overexpression of β-catenin has been reported for various cancer types, including gastric cancer [22]. To further investigate the interaction between rhBMP-2 and the β-catenin signaling pathway, we measured the β-catenin protein levels after rhBMP-2 treatment using western blot. The level of phosphorylated β-catenin protein was increased in both cell lines (Figure 7A). However, no change was observed in the level of β-catenin protein with rhBMP-2 treatment (Figure 7A). These data suggest that the β-catenin oncogene was significantly downregulated by the rhBMP-2 treatment of gastric cancer cells. To further investigate whether rhBMP-2 regulates c-Myc expression mediated through β-catenin in gastric cancer cells, we performed a β-catenin siRNA experiment with rhBMP-2 treatment. The silencing of β-catenin inhibited c-Myc protein expression in the SNU484 and SNU638 cells (Figure 7B). Furthermore, combination treatment of rhBMP-2 with the silencing of β-catenin significantly decreased the expression of c-Myc compared to rhBMP-2 treatment or silencing of β-catenin alone in SNU484 and SNU638 cells. These results suggest that the rhBMP-2-induced decrease in c-Myc expression was mediated through β-catenin in gastric cancer cells.

      DISCUSSION
      The aim of this study was to investigate the biological function of rhBMP-2 on the gene expression profile in human gastric cancer cells. RhBMP-2 significantly suppressed the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by changing the expression of genes involved in the progression and regulation of the cell cycle. We found that rhBMP-2 significantly downregulated c-Myc transcription activity in gastric cancer cells.
      Gene expression profiling has been used to identify biomarkers for the purpose of clarifying biological mechanisms [5, 23], categorizing cancer subtypes [5, 24], predicting cancer prognosis [5, 25], and elucidating gene expression in response to drugs [5, 26]. Since the safety issues concerning rhBMP-2 treatment have been debated since the beginning of its application, the effects of exogenous BMP-2 have been explored in many studies. In particular, gene expression profiling has been used to identify alterations in various signaling pathways by rhBMP-2 both in vitro and in vivo [27–30]. For example, Liu et al. reported that BMP-2 promotes the differentiation of osteoblasts and chondroblasts in RUXN2-deficient cell lines, and Zhou et al. reported that rhBMP-2 affects the gene expression of the TGF-beta/BMP pathways in human dermal fibroblasts [27, 28]. Zou et al. used a microarray analysis to demonstrate that rhBMP-2 recruits progenitor cells and promotes the proliferation and differentiation during anterior lumbar interbody fusion [31]. In addition, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas with high baseline BMP-2 protein levels are associated with higher rates of local recurrence [29]. This result supports the use of rhBMP-2 in tissue-engineering reconstructive approaches for cancer-related defects [29]. Although studies have been conducted regarding rhBMP-2 functions in the context of cancer [10, 14, 21, 29], the precise, comprehensive, and functional mechanisms through which rhBMP-2 affects gastric cancer cells remain unknown. In this study, we used gene expression profiling to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of rhBMP-2 in gastric cancer cells. We discovered that the expression of 1453 genes was increased or decreased at least twofold following rhBMP-2 treatment. Among these genes, 826 were increased and 609 were decreased in expression. Based on the GO analysis, many of these genes were enriched in cyclins and cell cycle regulation, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase, and G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation. We also found that rhBMP-2 treatment induced genes associated with the BMP-2 signaling pathway. In agreement with these microarray data, we found that rhBMP-2 stimulated the expression of BMP-2, BMPRI, and BMPRII proteins.
      Network upstream analysis revealed that rhBMP-2 significantly suppressed the expression of MYC and its downstream target genes AURKA, AURKB, CCNA2, CCNB2, CDC20, CDC25B, CDK1, CDK2, EZH2, and FOXM1. This downregulation of MYC signaling might be responsible for the inhibition of gastric cancer cell growth since we found that rhBMP-2 significantly suppressed SNU484 and SNU638 gastric cancer cell viability by MTT and soft agar colony formation assays. We validated c-Myc expression after treatment with rhBMP-2 by qPCR and western blot assay; we found that c-Myc expression was significantly suppressed by rhBMP-2 treatment in both types of gastric cancer cells. Myc is recognized as a crucial oncogene in many types of human cancers, including gastric cancer [32–34]. Therefore, the downregulation of c-Myc by rhBMP-2 might be responsible for the inhibition of gastric cancer cells.
      In addition, our data showed that rhBMP-2 stimulated a significant, time-dependent increase in the proportion of the cell population in G1 phase of the cell cycle in SNU484 cells. P53 and p21 expression were gradually increased after treatment with rhBMP-2. These results indicate that rhBMP-2 might regulate cell cycle arrest and thus, inhibit gastric cell proliferation. A study of AURKA and regulation of the cell cycle in cancer through multiple signal pathways found that AURKA diminished pRb, p53, P21waf1/cip1, and p27cip/kip but increased Plk1, CDC25, CDK1, and cyclin B1 to promote cell cycle progression [35]. Overexpression of AURKA inhibits p53 and p73 levels in cancer cells [32, 36, 37]. AURKA and AURKB are also overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, and the activation of AURKA and AURKB has oncogenic effects [38–42]. Therefore, both AURKA and AURKB appear to be associated with malignant phenotypes of cancer and function as oncogenes. We found that rhBMP-2 decreased mRNA and protein expression of AURKA and AURKB, and this may be linked to increased levels of p53 and p21 in gastric cancer cells, suggesting that rhBMP-2 arrests the cell cycle in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, we assumed that the down-regulation of c-Myc by rhBMP-2 seemed to be correlated with AURK in gastric cancer cells. To test the hypothesis that the down-regulation of c-Myc is mediated through AURK by rhBMP-2 in gastric cancer cells, we measured the expression of c-Myc using an AURK inhibitor with rhBMP-2 treatment. An AURK inhibitor decreased c-Myc expression levels in gastric cancer cells. In addition, combination treatment with an rhBMP-2 and AURK inhibitor significantly decreased c-Myc expression in SNU484 and SNU638 cells compared to treatment of the rhBMP-2 or AURK inhibitor alone. Several studies have reported that Myc and AURKA directly regulate each other at the transcriptional level in various cancer cells [32, 43, 44]. For instance, AURKA stimulates telomerase activity by upregulating Myc in human ovarian and breast epithelial cells [43]. Destruction of AURKA or Myc inhibits the malignant phenotypes of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [32]. In agreement with previously published articles, our results showed that there was a direct correlation with c-Myc expression and AURK, and both were suppressed by rhBMP-2 in gastric cancer cells. Therefore, our results suggest that the down-regulation of c-Myc by rhBMP-2 may be mediated through AURK, the downstream target genes of c-Myc, and induce the inhibition of the cell cycle.
      We also presented evidence that rhBMP-2 inhibited the activation of β-catenin in the gastric cancer cells SNU484 and SNU638. We found that rhBMP-2 increased phosphorylated β-catenin in gastric cancer cells. β-catenin is regarded as a downstream target of Wnt signaling and an upstream target of c-Myc [45, 46]. β-catenin is also known as an oncogene in human gastric cancer [46]. β-catenin regulates the expression of c-Myc and the cell cycle. From our data, silencing of β-catenin was found to significantly suppress c-Myc expression in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, the combination treatment of rhBMP-2 and β-catenin silencing significantly decreased c-Myc expression in gastric cancer cells compared to the treatment of rhBMP-2 alone or silencing of β-catenin alone. These results suggest that rhBMP-2 inhibits β-catenin and c-Myc expression in gastric cancer cells. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that rhBMP-2 suppresses the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway with their target genes and thus, causes gastric cancer cell death.
      In summary, our findings indicate that rhBNP-2 suppresses gastric cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting β-catenin and c-Myc with AURKA and AURKB expression to regulate inhibition of the cell cycle. RhBMP-2 may also be used as a therapeutic agent in gastric cancer. Further studies of rhBMP-2 in many cancers are needed because it is reported to have different effects on cell proliferation or invasion of human cancer. However, our data suggest that rhBMP-2 could be safely administered to patients who received gastric or gastroesophageal cancer surgery.

After 24 h, cells were treated with or without 1 μM rhBMP-2 for 72 h. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested. Pellets were lysed in ice-cold PRO-PREP™ (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seoul, South Korea), and the extracts were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatants were collected and the protein concentration determined using BSA protein assay kits (Pierces Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). The proteins were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking with 5% skim milk for 1 h, the blots were probed with primary antibodies against BMP-2, BMPRII, p-Smad1/5/8, β-catenin, p-β-catenin, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, c-Myc, Aurka, or Aurkb overnight followed by incubation with secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 1 h.

        Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) functions as a Mg2+/Ca2+-permeable channel fused with a kinase domain and regulates various physical processes and diseases. However, its effects on pathogenesis of human bladder cancer (BCa) has not been clarified yet. Our microarray analysis has suggested that calcium signaling pathway is connected with bladder cancer via MAPK pathway. Therefore, we aim to investigate the mechanism of TRPM7 in BCa tumorigenesis by using BCa tissues compared with normal bladder epithelium tissues, as well as using distinct BCa cell lines (EJ, 5637 and T24). We observed increased TRPM7 expression and dysregulation of proteins involved in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in BCa tissues. Moreover, knockdown of TRPM7 in BCa cells reversed the EMT status, accompanied by increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, TRPM7 deficiency could inhibit BCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as induce p-ERK1/2 and suppress PI3K/AKT at the protein level. Downregulation of TRPM7 promoted cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis in vitro, which could be recovered by pre-treatment with U0126 to deactivate ERK1/2, suggesting a close correlation between TRPM7 and the MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, a NOD/SCID mouse model transplanted using the BCa cells was established, revealing delayed tumor growth by reduced protein activity and mRNA transcription of TRPM7 in vivo. Our results suggested TRPM7 might be essential for BCa tumorigenesis by interfering BCa cell proliferation, motility and apoptosis.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      Bladder cancer (BCa) is one of the most common cancers worldwide [1]. Despite recent progress, the molecular mechanism underlying BCa pathogenesis remains to be further elucidated. Therefore, our group has generated a microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from several bladder cancer tissues comparing with normal bladder epithelium [2], suggesting calcium signaling pathway was linked with bladder cancer via MAPK signaling pathway, which was connected with cell cycle.
      Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play a key role in signal transduction from cell membrane to nucleus in response to a wide range of stimuli and are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation [3], survival, differentiation [4] and apoptosis [5]. Importantly, aberrant regulation of MAPK could contribute to cancer and other human diseases, including bladder cancer [6, 7]. Many studies have suggested that intracellular or extracellular calcium disorders might induce abnormal activation or deactivation of MAPK cascades [8, 9] and consequently initiate cancer development [10]. A recent publication using pathway network analyses revealed a major overlaps with various diseases and convergence upon MAPK and calcium signaling as well [11]. Studies using U0126, a selective MAPK kinase (MKK) inhibitor [12], have revealed a major effect on the deactivation of ERK1/2 [13] possibly even affecting MAPK-mediated mitochondrial-derived [14] and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis [15].
      Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a member of “chanzymes”, which function as a Mg2+/Ca2+-permeable channel fused with a kinase. TRPM7 has been reported to be ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues [16–18], suggesting that it could be implicated in important physiological processes such as cellular Mg2+ homeostasis [18], cell viability and growth [19], anoxic neuronal cell death [20], and cell adhesion [21]. Recent studies indicated a close correlation between TRPM7 and cancer, demonstrating its involvement in retinoblastoma [22], gastric cancer [23], breast cancer [24–27], nasopharyngeal carcinoma [28], pancreatic cancer [29], prostate cancer [30], and ovarian carcinoma [31]. Our previous studies have suggested that knockdown of TRPM8, another important subtype of the TRPM family, could inhibit proliferation of osteosarcoma and prostate cancer cells [32, 33]. In addition, our studies have suggested that TRPM7 affects kidney injury [34], revealing a correlation between the TRPM family and cell ability [35], cell growth as well as Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) [36], which was involved in malignancy of tumor. Another publication has reported that during stress condition, such as brain ischaemia, TRPM7 could control the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [37], which could have a Cross Talk with the EMT [38]. TRPM7 has been reported to be expressed in human and mouse urothelium [39, 40], as well as in MBT-2 mouse bladder cancer cells and T24 human bladder cancer cells [41], but its effect and mechanism in human bladder cancer remain largely unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that TRPM7, which is involved in the calcium signaling pathway, could affect bladder cancer by the MAPK signaling pathway to trigger BCa cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We aim to identify the alteration of TRPM7 and related proteins involved in the EMT regulation using BCa tissues in vivo, and to observe its effects on EMT, cell migration/invasion, apoptosis and cell cycle in distinct BCa cell lines in vitro for a potential strategy of rescue experiment, as well as to analyze the influence of tumor growth using nude mice in vivo with deactivated TRPM7 and downregulated TRPM7 at transcriptional level.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Microarray analysis revealed calcium and MAPK signaling pathways as central regulators in BCa development
        Three BCa tissues (stage II) and three normal bladder tissues were collected for alterations of mRNA by microarray analysis (Approval in Supplementary Information S1), suggesting 1338 genes (fold change > 1.5) (Supplementary Information S2) and 146 signaling pathways were significantly affected in the BCa tissues (Supplementary Information S3). Using a GCBI analysis tool, a pathway network connected to BCa was generated (Figure 1), indicating that a calcium signaling pathway was correlated with BCa via the MAPK signaling pathway connected with cell cycle regulation, as well as a central role of calcium and MAPK signaling pathways involved in the development of BCa. In addition, by annotation and overrepresentation analysis using our raw microarray data and DAVID database, we observed the genes involved in calcium signaling pathway were altered (Supplementary Figure S1A), accompanied by significantly upregulation of CALM, CaN and CAMK under the deficiency of TRPM7 in vitro (Supplementary Figure S1B–S1C). Therefore, we would like to investigate the alterations of the genes and proteins related with the pathways using bladder tissues and distinct BCa cell lines.

            Microarray analysis using mRNA isolated from BCa tissues and normal bladder epithelium tissues
            From the microarray results, 1338 genes (fold change > 1.5, Supplementary Information 2) and 146 signaling pathways (Supplementary Information 3) were screened out.

        Induction of TRPM7 and dysregulation of EMT markers in BCa tissues
        Immunofluorescence staining using ten BCa tissues and ten normal bladder tissues revealed a strong increase of OCT-4 in the cytoplasmic region of the BCa tissues (representative staining in Figure 2C–2D). Distinct human BCa cell lines (from high malignancy to low malignancy: T24, 5637, EJ, UM-UC-3, BIU-87, RT-4) and immortalized normal uroepithelial cell line (SV-HUC-1) exhibited a downregulation tendency of OCT-4 by Western blot analysis (Figure 2B), suggesting OCT-4 could be a marker for bladder cancer. qRT-PCR revealed that transcription of TRPM7 was upregulated in the BCa tissues compared with the normal bladder tissues (Figure 2A). TRPM7 was also induced in cytomembrane of the OCT4-positive cells in the BCa tissues (representative staining in Figure 2E a-b). Immunofluorescence analysis also suggested that distribution of proteins (E-cadherin and N-cadherin) involved in EMT process was strongly altered (representative staining in Figure 2E c-f). We observed a reduction of E-cadherin (Figure 2E c-d) and an increase of N-cadherin (Figure 2E e-f) in the OCT-4 positive cells in BCa tissues.

        Downregulation of TRPM7 reversed dysregulation of EMT markers in vitro
        To investigate the effects of TRPM7 in BCa, a model of TRPM7 deficiency in distinct BCa cell lines (T24, EJ and 5637) was established by siRNA transfection. The knockdown efficiency of the siRNA was validated by qRT-PCR (Figure 3B), Western blot analysis (Figure 3A), and immunofluorescence staining (representative staining in Figure 3C), indicating TRPM7 was remarkably silenced both at gene transcription and translation levels in the three BCa cells transfected by the siRNA. In contrast to the decrease of E-cadherin and increase of N-cadherin noticed in the BCa tissues (Figure 2E c-f). Knockdown of TRPM7 triggered strong upregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and considerable downregulation of the two mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and Vimentin, revealed by Western blot analysis (Figure 3D) and immunofluorescence staining (representative staining in Figure 3E–3G), suggesting reduced TRPM7 could alleviate malignancy of the BCa cells.

        Induction of ROS in BCa cells with TRPM7 deficiency
        The status of ROS in the BCa cells (T24 and EJ) were measured by flow cytometry analysis (Supplementary Figure S2A) and fluorescence staining (Supplementary Figure S2C). Statistical analysis (Supplementary Figure S2B) revealed a significantly increase ROS in the siTRPM7-treated BCa cells by the flow cytometry measurement. Western blot analysis indicated an increased protein abundance of Catalase and SOD2 in the BCa cells with downregulated TRPM7 (Supplementary Figure S2D).
      
      
        TRPM7 deficiency impaired BCa cells motility and invasion via the PI3K/AKT pathway
        The relationship between TRPM7 and BCa cell motility and invasion was investigated using transwell and wound healing assays. Transwell assay suggested that knockdown of TRPM7 in BCa cells could reduce cell migration and invasion (Figure 4A), which was confirmed by statistically analysis in Figure 4B–4C. Moreover, wound healing assay revealed that TRPM7 deficiency in BCa cells could reduce the number of migrated cells (Figure 4D). The gap closure (%) was statistically analyzed (Figure 4E). Furthermore, downregulation of p-FAK and MMP2/9 in BCa cells with siTRPM7 was noticed (Figure 4F). Interestingly, we have also observed the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a downstream of FAK [42], was affected by TRPM7 deficiency as well, revealing a strong reduction of p-PI3K and p-AKT (Figure 4F).

Statistical significance was calculated using ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

        Knockdown of TRPM7 triggered G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the BCa cells
        CCK-8 assay revealed that TRPM7 deficiency induced inhibition of cell growth, compared with the parental and siCON cells (Figure 5A). To better understand the underlying mechanism, the effects of TRPM7 on cell cycle (Figure 5B) and apoptosis (Figure 6A–6B) were analyzed using flow cytometry analysis. Compared with the control cells, knockdown of TRPM7 in the BCa cells triggered cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase (statistically analyzed in Figure 5B) as well as a reduction in the proportion of cells in S phase. Indeed, cell cycle related proteins such as Cyclin D1 and CDK2/4 were decreased in the BCa cells with TRPM7 knockdown (Figure 5C). Moreover, TRPM7 deficiency resulted in a significant increase of the apoptotic BCa cells (Figure 6A–6B). We have analyzed the alterations of proteins involved in the apoptosis by Western blot (Figure 6C–6D), exhibiting upregulation of the apoptosis inducer BAX [43, 44] and downregulation of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL2 [45, 46] in the siTRPM7-treated BCa cells. Furthermore, pro-caspase 3, a downstream protein of BCL2 and BAX in the apoptotic cascade [47], was decreased, and its active form cleaved-caspase 3 was increased (Figure 6C). Moreover, we have found that Cytochrome C was also upregulated, suggesting that TRPM7 deficiency could trigger BCa cell apoptosis through a mitochondrial-dependent manner [48] (Figure 6C). Another key family, the MAPK including ERK1/2, JNK and p38, which are involved in the development and apoptosis regulation of tumor cells, was also altered in the siTRPM7-treated BCa cells (Figure 6D). TRPM7 deficiency strongly induced phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in the BCa cells, with only a mild impact on p-JNK and p-p38.

        We have pre-treated the BCa cells using U0126 to repress the activity of ERK1/2 and transfected with siTRPM7 and controls, revealing a significant recovery of cell growth delay triggered by TRPM7 deficiency in all the three BCa cells indicated by the CCK-8 assay (Figure 7A). Importantly, flow cytometry analysis exhibited that deactivation of ERK1/2 through pre-treatment with the U0126 (Figure 7B), could reverse TRPM7 deficiency induced apoptosis (statistically analyzed in Figure 7C), as demonstrated by reduced p-ERK1/2 and reversed BAX/BCL2 ratio, as well as decreased Cytochrome C and cleaved-caspase 3 using Western blot analysis (Figure 7D).

        Reduction of either TRPM7 protein activity by carvacrol or TRPM7 gene transcription by lentiviral-shRNA could inhibit bladder cancer growth in vivo
        To further analyze the effects of TRPM7 activity in BCa tumorigenesis in vivo, a NOD/SCID mouse model transplanted with T24 cells was established (Figure 8A– 8B). Two weeks after the transplantation, carvarcrol was intraperitoneally injected in the mice to inhibit the activity of TRPM7 (Figure 8A–8B, b). In contrast, other mice transplanted with T24 were injected by saline as control (Figure 8A–8B, a). The difference of tumor size for the carvacrol treated mice and the control mice was statistically analyzed in Figure 8C, suggesting a reduced tumor growth by the deactivation of TRPM7 protein in vivo. In addition, we also transplanted the T24 cells infected with lentiviral-TRPM7-shRNA (T24 LV-M7sh) to observe the tumor growth under downregulation of TRPM7 at transcriptional level (Figure 8D–8E). We noticed significantly decreased tumor size (Figure 8F) and weight (Figure 8G) triggered by TRPM7 deficiency comparing with the control group (T24 LV-NC).

        Overexpression of TRPM7 induced BCa cell proliferation and motility
        BCa cells (T24 and EJ) were transfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO/HA-TRPM7 vector to overexpress TRPM7 (Supplementary Figure S3A), which could trigger significantly increased cell proliferation revealed by CCK- 8 assay (Supplementary Figure S3B) and clonogenic survival assay (Supplementary Figure S3C). Induction of T24 and EJ cell migration rates was suggested by transwell migration assay, confirmed by the statistically analysis (Supplementary Figure S3D).
      
    
    
      DISCUSSION
      The TRPM family, an essential family of proteins exhibited distinct functions on tumorigenesis [49, 50]. Our group has reported that the TRPM family could regulate cell cycle and growth in human osteosarcoma and prostate cancer cells [32, 51]. The present study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of TRPM7, an important TRPM family member involved in Ca2+-permeable channel, on human bladder cancer, which remains largely unknown yet. Microarray analysis using human bladder cancer tissues compared with normal bladder epithelium tissues has suggested a close correlation between calcium signaling pathway and bladder cancer via MAPK signaling pathway, confirmed by overrepresentation using microarray raw data and DAVID database. We analyzed gene expression and protein abundance of TRPM7 in BCa tissues, observing a strong upregulation of TRPM7 at the gene expression and protein level by double immunofluorescence staining analysis, co-localized with OCT-4, a potential marker for BCa cells [52, 53]. Moreover, we noticed the upregulation of TRPM7 may be correlated with the EMT markers in the BCa tissue, which could reveal the malignancy of tumor [54, 55].
      We have selected three typical BCa cell lines with distinguished malignancy, T24, EJ and 5637, to generate the BCa cell model with TRPM7 deficiency using siRNA transfection. Indeed, we confirmed that knockdown of TRPM7 in the three BCa cell lines at gene expression and protein levels. Moreover, downregulation of TRPM7 resulted in a reversed status for the EMT markers, suggesting deficiency of TRPM7 could alleviate malignancy of BCa. Furthermore, our results revealed a significant increase of ROS status and protein abundance involved in the ROS metabolism in the BCa cells with downregulated TRPM7, suggesting a correlation between TRPM7 and ROS in BCa cells.
      Knockdown of TRPM7 could reverse EMT markers in the three BCa cells, and we also observed that TRPM7 deficiency could also inhibit migration and invasion of BCa cells, as EMT has been reported to play a critical role in cancer cell migration and invasion [56]. To confirm the effect triggered by siTRPM7 treatment, we have established a BCa cell model with TRPM7-overexpression and noticed the migration rate was significantly increased. Moreover, treatment of siTRPM7 could also reduce MMP2/9 and phosphorylated FAK, PI3K, AKT in the BCa cells. Recent studies suggested FAK is a participant in focal adhesion dynamics between cells, playing a key role in cell motility [57] and MMPs could degrade the extracellular matrix and promote cancer cells to metastasize [58, 59]. Another publications reported that PI3K/AKT is a key signaling pathway [60, 61], which was deactivated by the TRPM7 deficiency in our study as well, suggesting that inhibited BCa cell motility triggered by TRPM7 knockdown could be via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
      A major effect of TRPM7 was to induce delayed cell proliferation, cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis in the BCa cells with TRPM7 deficiency. Proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, CCND1 and CDK2/4, were all reduced after the siTRPM7 treatment. Moreover, proteins involved in apoptosis were strongly altered, especially imbalance of the BAX/BCL2 ratio, which is involved in mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis [62, 63], and related proteins including cleaved-caspase 3 [64, 65] and Cytochrome C [66, 67], suggesting that TRPM7 deficiency could trigger a mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, as suggested by our microarray analysis, MAPK signaling pathway, a central regulator in the pathway network, could be altered by the affected calcium signaling pathway due to TRPM7 knockdown. Western blot analysis indicated ERK1/2, a member of MAPK family, was remarkably increased in the phosphorylated form, suggesting knockdown of TRPM7 might induce a mitochondrial dependent apoptosis via ERK1/2, which could be activated by phosphorylation on specific sites and promote either intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways by induction of mitochondrial Cytochrome C release or caspase-8 activation, permanent cell cycle arrest or autophagic vacuolization [68].
      Therefore, we deactivated ERK1/2 by pre-treatment of U0126 in the three BCa cells and noticed a decrease of the p-ERK1/2 at protein level. Furthermore, the delayed cell growth caused by siTRPM7 was reversed significantly, and the apoptotic cell rates were significantly reduced by ERK1/2 inhibition, as well as the proteins involved in the apoptosis pathway were recovered to the level of the control group. Importantly, we have established a T24-transplanted NOD/SCID mouse model with carvacrol [69] and lentiviral-shRNA treatment respectively, observing a significant delayed tumor growth by both reduction of TRPM7 protein activity and TRPM7 gene transcription. Therefore, our results in vitro and in vivo have revealed that the downregulation of TRPM7 could reduce the BCa cell proliferation, trigger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In conclusion, downregulated TRPM7 could reduce the activity of bladder cancer cells and induce cell apoptosis via ERK1/2 pathway.

Each RNA sample was digested by DNase I (RNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen, Cat #79254) to remove possible contamination of genomic DNA. The quantity of isolated RNA was measured by a NanoDrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA).
      
      
        Microarray analysis of mRNA isolated from human bladder tissues
        Our group has established a microarray analysis using mRNA isolated from the three stage II bladder cancer tissues and the three normal bladder tissues, as described by Wang et al. in 2016 [2]. Briefly, according to the standard Affymetrix protocol, 250 ng total RNA of each sample was prepared to biotinylated cDNA by Ambion® WT Expression Kit. On GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0, 5.5 μg of cDNA were hybridized for 16 h at 45°C, continuously washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450, scanned by using Affymetrix® GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) installed in GeneChip® Scanner 3000 (7G). Data analysis was with a Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. By Gene ontology (GO) and pathway-Relation-Network (Path-net) analysis tools based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway Database using Gene Cloud of Biotechnology Information (GCBI Plateform, Shanghai, China) [70], genes and pathways correlated with bladder cancer were generated. The resulting gene list was subjected to the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [71] as well for annotation and overrepresentation analysis of the genes involved in calcium signaling pathway (Supplementary Figure S2). The microarray data was submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number GSE76211. All data are MIAME compliant.
      
      
        Reverse transcription and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR)
        1 μg of total RNA isolated from bladder tissues or BCa cells was mixed with oligo (dT) 12–18 primers to synthesize first-strand cDNA by using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, China). 1 μg cDNA were used for each reaction of the polymerase chain reactions (PCR) in a final volume of 20 μl. All primers conducted with the SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio, China) were tested for optimal annealing temperatures and PCR conditions were optimized with gradient PCRs on a Bio-Rad iCycler (Cat. #CFX96). Primer sequences and annealing temperatures are summarized in Table 1. Values were normalized for amplified β-actin alleles. Relative gene abundance = 2−ΔΔct, Δct = cttarget gene - ctβ-actin, for BCa cells ΔΔct = ΔctsiRNA-treated - ΔctsiRNA-untreated, for bladder tissues ΔΔct = ΔctBCa tissues - Δctnormal bladder tissues (ct = threshold cycle).

        Knockdown and overexpression of TRPM7 in the BCa cells
        TRPM7-target specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and lentiviral small hairpin RNA (LV-shRNA) were synthesized by Genepharma Ltd. in Suzhou, China. Distinct BCa cells (T24, EJ and 5637) were transfected with TRPM7-siRNA (siTRPM7) using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sense sequence of TRPM7-siRNA (siTRPM7) / TRPM7-shRNA (shTRPM7) was 5′-GUCUUGCCAUGAAAUACUCTT-3′, and the sense sequence of control-siRNA (siCON) / control-shRNA (shCON) was 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCAGGUTT-3′. After transfection by siTRPM7 for 48 h, alterations of TRPM7 at transcriptional and protein levels were evaluated by the qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining analysis. The BCa cells infected by lentiviral-TRPM7-shRNA (LV-M7sh) and lentiviral-control-shRNA (LV-NC) were treated by 0.8 mg/ml puromycin (Sigma, USA) for 14 days to select the antibiotic-resistant cells xenotransplanted into NOD/SCID mice.
        The plasmid of TRPM7-overexpression (pcDNA5/FRT/TO/HA-TRPM7 vector) was a gift from Professor Loren W. Runnels at University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, USA. The cell model of TRPM7-overexpression was established according to Su et al. [72] from the group of Professor Runnels. Briefly, the BCa cells (EJ and T24) were transfected by the pcDNA5/FRT/TO/HA-TRPM7 vector and induced by 1 mg/ml tetracyclines for 48 h.
      
      
        Pre-treatment using MKK inhibitor for rescue experiments
        Before siRNA transfection, BCa cells were pre-treated by MKK inhibitor U0126 (Sigma, USA) at 10 mM for 2 h to deactivate ERK1/2 [13, 73, 74]. BCa cells in the untreated group were pre-incubated with appropriate amount of vehicle (0.1% DMSO). Both groups were submitted for the RNA interference and alterations of cell viability and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively.
      
      
        Wound healing assay
        When the BCa cells grew to 95% confluence, a 200 μl pipette tip was used to scratch a wound to cell monolayer. After scratching, cells were washed with PBS several times to remove non-adherent debris, then 0.5% FBS medium was added to allow cells to move into the gap without the influence of serum. Four different equidistant points of the scratched area were photographically measured and imaged by an inverted phase contrast microscope (Leica, Cat. #DMI 1) at 0 h, 12 h and 24 h. Migration rate was calculated as the proportion of initial scratch distant of each sample using the mean distance between both borderlines that remain cell-free after cell migration.
      
      
        Transwell migration assay
        A 24-well plate transwell chamber system (Corning, USA) with 8.0 μm pore size was used. Cells were suspended in 0.5% FBS medium at a density of 5 × 105 cell/ml and 100 μl cell suspension was seeded in the upper chamber insert without ligand, while the lower chamber was filled with 10% FBS medium. After 24 h incubation at 37°C, cells on the upper insert were removed by cotton swabs, and cells that migrated to the lower side were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with crystal violet. Then the chambers were placed under an inverted phase contrast microscope and 16 random areas were selected to observe and count the migrated cells.
      
      
        Transwell invasion assay
        In transwell invasion analysis, 40 μl ECM gel solution (Sigma, USA) diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml was coated on the surface of the upper insert of Transwell chamber and placed in a 37°C incubator for overnight. BCa cells were then suspended in 0.5°C FBS medium at a density of 8 × 105 cell/ml and 100 μl cell suspension was seeded in the upper chamber insert. After incubation 48 h at 37°C, cells were fixed, stained and counted under an inverted phase contrast microscope.
      
      
        CCK-8 assay
        Cell Counting Kit-8 (Roche Biochemicals, Germany) was used for cell viability measurement. 100 μl cell suspensions (2 × 104 cells per ml) with 10% FBS medium was seeded to a 96-well plate and incubated for 5 days at 37°C. Then, 10 μl CCK-8 reagent was added to each well at the indicated time and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm by a Rayto-6000 system (Rayto, China).
      
      
        Clonogenic survival assay
        BCa cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1500 cells per well) and grew into colonies for approximately 15 days. Colonies were emerged and fixed by 4% PFA for 30 min, staining with crystal violet, counted and defined as aggregates of 50 or more cells and photographed.
      
      
        Flow cytometry analysis for alterations of cell cycle and apoptosis
        For cell cycle analysis, 1 × 106 cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ice cold ethanol at −20°C for overnight. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended with PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 0.1 mg/ml RNaseA (20 μg/ml in PBS) in the dark. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the DNA content distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry analysis (Beckman, Cat. #FC500). For apoptosis analysis, after transfection for 48 h, cells were collected, washed with PBS, and stained with FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD biosciences, USA) and analyzed by the flow cytometry analysis.
      
      
        ROS detection by staining with DCFH-DA
        The fluorescent probe 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to evaluate intracellular ROS levels. BCa cells transfected with siTRPM7 and siCON were used for this experiment. After transfection of cells and growth for 48 h, 10 μmol of DCFH-DA (Sigma, USA) was added to 2 ml medium, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed three times with PBS and submitted to flow cytometry analysis. For ROS staining, slides with the BCa cells were stained by DCFH-DA and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, then washed by PBS three times. Nuclei were counterstained with 1 μM DAPI for 20 min at room temperature. Images were taken with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Cat. #IX73).
      
      
        Protein analyses
      
      
        Isolation of total protein from BCa cells and Western blot analysis
        The BCa cells (T24, EJ and 5637) were sonicated and lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) on ice for 30 min, then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min to collect supernatant. By Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Germany) the concentrations of protein were determined using Bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. The isolated total protein was resolved using 6–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA). Membranes were blocked by 5% non-fat milk and incubated with primary antibodies (Table 2) at 4°C for overnight. After washing, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody (listed in Table 3) at room temperature for 2 h. Bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Bio-rad, USA) and detected by Kodak Biomax MR films.

        Immunofluorescence staining for human bladder tissue samples
        Histological diagnosis of bladder tissues were examined by two experienced pathologists independently. All the samples were fixed by 4% PFA at 4°C overnight and embedded into paraffin (Paraplast, Sigma-Aldrich) using tissue processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. #STP 120). Paraffin sections (4 μm) were cut with a rotation microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. #HM325). The sections were serially incubated with indicated primary antibody (listed in Table 2) and Cy3-labeled or FITC- labeled secondary antibody (listed in Table 3) in humidified atmosphere. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI (2 μg/ml). Sections were analyzed by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Cat. #IX73).

Cells were then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 solution and blocked in normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Afterwards, cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibody (Table 2) at the proper dilution for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with Cy3-labeled or FITC- labeled secondary antibody (Table 3) for 1 h. Nuclei were visualized with 1 mM TOTO-3 iodide for 10 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence staining was analyzed using a confocal microscope (Leica, Cat. #SP8).
      
      
        Xenograft model
        Male NOD/SCID mice were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd. in Beijing, China. Six mice at Day 42 were subcutaneously injected with T24 cells at a concentration of 4 × 107/ml diluted in PBS (100 μl for each mouse) and grown for 14 days [75]. Three mice of them were intraperitoneally injected by carvacrol at 50 mg/ml (200 μl for each mouse) and repeated for 28 days to inhibit activity of TRPM7 [69]. The other three mice were treated by 0.9% saline (200 μl for each mouse) for 28 days as control.
        Lentiviral-TRPM7-shRNA and lentiviral-control-shRNA infected T24 cells were subcutaneously injected to ten mice, respectively, diluted in PBS (200 μl per mouse) at a concentration of 2 × 107/ml cells. The tumor size for each mouse was measured every four days using a caliper and counted as: tumor size = length × width2 × 0.5 mm3 [76]. The growth of the tumor was observed for 42 days, and the mice was sacrificed to measure the tumor weight.
      
      
        Statistical analyses
        Data were expressed as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. All analyses were performed three times and represent data from three individual experiments. Two-tailed Student's t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences of the data. All of the statistical analyses were performed with SPSS16.0. The statistical significance was set at probability values of p < 0.05.

          Background
          MicroRNAs always function cooperatively in their regulation of gene expression. Dysfunctions of these co-functional microRNAs can play significant roles in disease development. We are interested in those multi-disease associated co-functional microRNAs that regulate their common dysfunctional target genes cooperatively in the development of multiple diseases. The research is potentially useful for human disease studies at the transcriptional level and for the study of multi-purpose microRNA therapeutics.
        
        
          Methods and results
          We designed a computational method to detect multi-disease associated co-functional microRNA pairs and conducted cross disease analysis on a reconstructed disease-gene-microRNA (DGR) tripartite network. The construction of the DGR tripartite network is by the integration of newly predicted disease-microRNA associations with those relationships of diseases, microRNAs and genes maintained by existing databases. The prediction method uses a set of reliable negative samples of disease-microRNA association and a pre-computed kernel matrix instead of kernel functions. From this reconstructed DGR tripartite network, multi-disease associated co-functional microRNA pairs are detected together with their common dysfunctional target genes and ranked by a novel scoring method. We also conducted proof-of-concept case studies on cancer-related co-functional microRNA pairs as well as on non-cancer disease-related microRNA pairs.
        
        
          Conclusions
          With the prioritization of the co-functional microRNAs that relate to a series of diseases, we found that the co-function phenomenon is not unusual. We also confirmed that the regulation of the microRNAs for the development of cancers is more complex and have more unique properties than those of non-cancer diseases.

      Background
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA of ∼22 nucleotides, are significant regulation molecules for diverse cellular processes such as cell development, proliferation and differentiation [1–7]. Pairs of miRNAs can work cooperatively to regulate an individual gene or a cohort of genes that participate in similar processes [8, 9]. This cooperativity (or co-function) is a frequent regulation mechanism of miRNAs for an enhanced target repression which has exhibited distinctive and fine-tuned target gene expression patterns [10]. Investigation on miRNA cooperativity can systematically understand miRNA functions [11] to detect their potential disease links [12].
      Using miRNAs as diagnostic and therapeutic targets, miRNA therapeutics is a promising research area that designs sophisticated strategies to restore or inhibit miRNA expression for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. For example, a therapy with the vector-encoded pair miR-15a and miR-16-1 has been proposed for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) [13]; The microRNA cluster miR-216a/217 was reported to target genes PTEN and SMAD7 to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which can promote the drug resistance and recurrence of liver cancer [14]. Such co-functional miRNA pairs are more suitable as drug targets instead of using individual ones. Large scale detection of novel co-functional miRNA pairs is an important pre-step to identify proper miRNA pairs as more effective drug targets. Currently, abundant disease-gene association information are stored in Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man (OMIM) [15] and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database(CTD) [16]; disease-miRNA associations are recorded in miR2Disease [17] and HMDD [18]; and miRNA-target regulations are recorded in miRecord [19] and miRTarBase [20]. Linking and integrating these databases, it can be inferred which diseases are correlated with the same genes or with the same miRNAs, and which miRNAs have the same target disease genes. Our hypothesis is that some of the miRNAs can regulate their common targets cooperatively and have roles in the development of a series of diseases.
      The focus of this work is on the detection and prioritization of multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs. A multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pair is a pair of miRNAs whose common target genes are associated with a series of diseases. Here, the definition of co-function for the miRNA pairs is broader than the definition of cooperativity as proposed in [21, 22]. Figure 1 shows an example of multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs detected from a disease-gene-miRNA (DGR) tripartite network. From this example, we can see that multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs may hold a vast mechanism underlying multiple disease development, similarly like the basic cellular functions maintained by housekeeping genes. More importantly, these miRNAs can be considered as the common drug targets of these diseases for the design and development of multi-purpose drugs.
Fig. 1An example: From a DGR tripartite network to a co-functional miRNA pair. The network in panel a contains known associations between the genes g1, g2, g3, g4, and g5, the diseases d1, d2, d3, and d4, and the miRNAs R1, R2, R3, and R4. In this example, miRNAs R2 and R3 are both associated with all the four diseases. However, the other three miRNAs are each associated with only one of these diseases. All these four diseases are associated with two common genes g4 and g5. Meanwhile, both of g4 and g5 are the targets of miRNAs R2 and R3. It is believed that R2-R3-g4-g5 in panel b may form a functional module that associated with the development of all the four diseases

      MiRNA co-function mechanisms have attracted intensive research recently [9, 11, 12, 23, 24], with the focus on the analysis of miRNA-target networks or on the analysis of disease-miRNA associations for a specific disease. Our work advances the current research with two steps: (i) We reconstruct a DGR tripartite network through the integration of existing databases with our newly predicted disease-miRNA associations, and (ii) we propose a novel scoring method to prioritize the potential multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs. Since the relationships between the exact miRNAs and diseases are largely unknown, computational methods are required to make prediction of disease-related miRNAs for constructing the disease-miRNA network in the DGR tripartite. For example, network-based or semi-supervised prediction methods [25–27], or the methods via support vector machines [28, 29] can be used among some other prediction methods [30–32]. The key idea in the similarity assessment adopted by most of these methods is that: similar RNAs (functionally similar) are always associated with similar diseases (phenotypically similar, genotypically similar or semantically similar). During the training of the existing prediction methods, the disease-miRNA pairs without known relationships are thought to be ranked at bad positions or are regarded as negative samples directly. As some (probably many) of the unknown disease-miRNA pairs in the training data are true in fact, the false positive rates by the literature methods are high in the prediction of disease related miRNAs. On the other hand, the use of negative samples by the literature methods is straightforward without consideration of gene expression properties of miRNAs.
      To improve the prediction performance, we propose a new method to make predictions of disease-related miRNAs. Two new ideas are explored. One is the construction of a set of reliable negative samples of disease-miRNA association through miRNA expression comparison between control and diseased subjects. The second idea is the use of precomputed kernel matrix for support vector machines, which can avoid the step to tune the parameters of the kernel functions. The area under the ROC curve(AUC) performance of our method is much superior to the literature methods on bench-marking data sets. Our case studies have demonstrated that our prediction method can also work well even when a disease has no currently known disease-related miRNAs. Combining our predicted disease-miRNA associations with those literature-maintained associations between diseases, miRNAs and genes, we construct a more complete DGR tripartite network to detect and prioritize multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs. Given a miRNA pair, our scoring method cfscore considers the function relationship between the two miRNAs, the co-dysexpression of the two miRNAs in the disease tissues and the relationship between the common target genes and the associated diseases of these miRNAs. We are also interested in finding the exact targets dysregulated by the co-functional miRNA pair during the diseases’ development. We call them the co-functional targets of the co-functional miRNA pair. The flowchart of our work is described in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2The flowchart of our prediction and scoring method. Our work includes the parts such as material collection, similarity computing, association prediction, network reconstruction, scoring and prioritization of the co-function miRNA pairs and result output

      This method was tested on the cancer and non-cancer disease related DGR tripartite networks. The top 50 multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs were concentrated for deep analysis. We found that most of them were from the same miRNA families or miRNA clusters. The comparison of the co-functional pairs from the two DGR networks suggests that the dysregulation mechanisms of miRNAs in the cancers are more complex. It has also been shown that the analysis of multi-disease associated co-functional miRNAs can help understand the regulation mechanisms of miRNAs in the development of different diseases and thus can provide new knowledge for the diagnosis or treatment of the diseases.

        Multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs and their common dysfunctional target genes
        Two cancer-gene-miRNA tripartite networks were constructed to investigate the performance of our method for detecting and ranking multi-cancer associated co-functional miRNA pairs. As a pre-processing step, we merged the miRCancer database [33] with miR2Disease [17] and HMDD [18], and collected 3655 cancer-miRNA associations between 83 cancers and 503 miRNAs. Connecting these miRNAs and diseases to their associated genes, the first cancer-gene-miRNA tripartite network was constructed. Then, all the 3655 cancer-miRNA associations (as positive samples) and a balanced set of 3655 negative samples of cancer-miRNA association in this tripartite network were used together to train our prediction model for inferring new cancer-miRNA associations. The prediction model was applied to all the un-connected disease-miRNA pairs between the 83 cancers and 503 miRNAs to predict whether some of them have associations or not. When a pair was predicted to have an association between a cancer and a miRNA, a probability was also estimated. A total of 3000 top-ranked associations were added to the first cancer-gene-miRNA tripartite network to form the second cancer-gene-miRNA tripartite network (i.e., a reconstructed network by adding the predicted cancer-miRNA associations). Those associations can be found in the Additional file 1.
        On average, the 503 miRNAs are associated with 7 or 13 cancers for the first and the reconstructed network respectively; and there are 2532 and 5634 miRNA pairs in these two networks that have a cfScore larger than 0 and that are associated with at least 10 cancers. There are very few literature proving the miRNA pairs can co-function in the development of more than 10 different diseases. To understand whether these miRNA pairs co-function in the development of some of the diseases, we manually searched and examined relevant literature to confirm that the individual miRNAs in the pairs can function cooperatively to regulate the same targets. Of the top-ranked 50 miRNA pairs from our reconstructed network, 40 pairs can be validated to be co-functional pairs by the literature, in comparison with 35 of the top 50 pairs from the first tripartite network. This implies that the addition of the predicted disease-miRNA associations into the tripartite network is useful and effective for the study of co-functional miRNA pairs. Here, we can just confirm these pairs of miRNAs are co-functional miRNA pairs but not multi-disease associated co-functional ones. We could not find any literature that discusses the relationship between miRNAs and a series of diseases.
        Details of the 50 miRNA pairs are shown in Fig. 3, where on the label of every edge, the first number represents the ranking position of the miRNA pair. If the rank number is followed by one or more gene names, it represents that the miRNA pair is a co-functional pair and has validated common targets. The number at the end of the label is the number of diseases that may associate with this co-functional pair. These multi-cancer associated co-functional miRNA pairs are mostly from the same clusters or families such as from the let-7 family (let-7a ∼7e and miR-98) and the miR-17 ∼92 cluster (miR-17-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92). It has been known that clustered miRNAs or those miRNAs from the same family are evolved from a common ancestor and can target functionally related genes [34]. Thus, it can be easily understood that miRNAs from the same cluster or family have similar functions and can always function cooperatively. However, not all those miRNAs in the same families or clusters can co-function with each other as their target genes are not completely overlapped. Moreover, some miRNAs that belong to different families or clusters can be co-functional miRNAs. For example, the 17th-ranked pair miR-497-5p-miR-424-5p is a co-functional miRNA pair. However, as recorded by miRBase, miR-424-5p is a member of mir-322 gene family while miR-497-5p stems from the mir-497 family. The pair is also not clustered.
Fig. 3The 50 top-ranked co-functional miRNA pairs from the reconstructed cancer-miRNA-gene network. The labels along the edges illustrate the co-function information of the miRNAs. The first number of each label is the rank of the corresponding pair according to our prioritization method. The following gene symbols are the validated common targets during the co-functioning of the pair of miRNAs. The last number shows the potential diseases that related to this co-function pair

        The 5th-ranked pair, miR-15b and miR-195, both belong to the miR-15 family, and both of them can target gene BCL2, an important apoptosis inhibitor. This pair of miRNAs can also work together with another miRNA (miR-16) in regulation [35]. We hypothesize that this co-functional pair may dysregulate their targets cooperatively, leading to the development of 38 different cancers such as prostate cancer (DOID:10283), prostate carcinoma (DOID:10286), stomach cancer (DOID:10534), and breast cancer (DOID:1612). The top three potential common targets of this miRNA pair are genes BCL2 (entrez id:596), CDKN1A (entrez id:1026), and CCND1(entrez id:595). We have verified that these three genes are individually related to most of (68%, 68% or 66%) the 38 cancers. Furthermore, these three genes are all involved in four KEGG [36] pathways: hsa05215: Prostate cancer (p-value=1.5E-4), hsa05206: MicroRNAs in cancer (p-value=1.7E-3), hsa04151: PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (p-value=2.5E-3) and hsa05200: Pathways in cancer (p-value=3.2E-3) as revealed by the DAVID functional annotation tool [37, 38]. Moreover, the three genes all have the functions of the cellular response to DNA damage stimulus (GO:0006974, p-value=1.4E-4) and response to drug (GO:0042493, p-value=4.0E-4), which are important functions for the normal cells. Based on these analysis and evidences, it is suggested that the pair of miR-15b and miR-195 may contribute to the development of all the 38 different types of cancers via a similar regulation mechanism. More details of the discovered miRNA pairs and references are listed in Additional file 2.
        We were also interested in the problem of whether the co-functional phenomenon for the non-cancer disease related miRNAs is the same as those of cancers. Thus, we constructed a non-cancer disease related DGR tripartite network containing 1625 non-cancer disease-miRNA associations between 334 miRNAs and 174 diseases extracted from the three existing databases and also containing 1625 predicted associations (Additional file 1). There were just 13 multi-non-cancer-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs having a cfscore bigger than 0 and associating with no less than 10 different diseases. Again, we manually examined these candidate co-functional miRNA pairs. We found that 11 of them can be validated with strong evidence from literature (Additional file 2). Furthermore, 5 of the 13 pairs overlap with the cancer related top 50 miRNA pairs. This indicates that the co-functional mechanism exists not only for the cancer related miRNAs but also for non-cancer disease related miRNAs.
      
      
        An in-depth analysis of the 5 overlapping co-functional miRNA pairs
        To further understand the regulation mechanism of the co-functional miRNA pairs, we particularly focused on the common targets of the 5 overlapping co-functional pairs (Table 1). The first two columns list the two individual miRNAs in the co-functional miRNA pairs, the third column shows the ranks of those co-functional miRNA pairs. In the forth column, the number of diseases that may relate to the miRNA pairs are displayed, and the last column lists the co-functional targets of these miRNA pairs which are related to multiple diseases. Here, a target gene is ranked higher if it relates to more diseases. It can be seen that even though there are common co-functional miRNA pairs between cancers and non-cancer diseases, the co-functional targets of these miRNA pairs are different from each other. For example, for the two miRNA pairs that both are members of the miR-15 family (miR-15a/b), the top three possible co-functional targets for the non-cancer diseases are IFNG, MTHFR, RARB, while for cancers are BCL2, CDKN1A and CCND1. Meanwhile, there are a lot of genes repeatedly relate to various miRNA pairs such as the last three miRNA pairs from Table 1. Thus these miRNA pairs may function cooperatively and can form a co-functional module. This co-functional module is related to both of multi-cancers and multi-non-cancer diseases.

        To reveal the detailed regulation mode of these miRNAs associating with multiple cancers and non-cancer diseases, we conducted a deep case analysis. In Fig. 4, the top ten common target genes of each co-functional pair were combined to be a gene set. The DAVID functional annotation tool [37, 38] was applied to analyze these gene sets of the co-functional pairs in the module miR-29a-miR-29b-miR-29c, where the threshold of the pathway enrichment analysis [36] was set as p-value ≤0.05 (not the adjusted p-value, the following p-values are all not adjusted ones). The labels on the edges from the diseases to the genes are the probabilities of genes to be the co-functional targets of the miRNA co-function module. For example, the edge from the diseases to the gene VEGFA has the label of “C 77% N 23%”. This label means that the co-function module may dysregulate the gene VEGFA to contribute to the development of the 26 cancers (C) with the probability of 77%. This gene may also be the common target of the co-functional module during the dysregulation in the development of those 13 non-cancer disease (N) with the probability of 23%. The labels along with the edges connecting the genes and the pathways indicate that the genes from the target gene sets of the diseases (i.e., cancers (C) or non-cancer diseases (N)) associated co-function module can be mapped to the corresponding pathways. For instance, there are three edges connecting the genes with the pathway ‘hsa05219: Bladder cancer’ together with the labels of “C N VEGFA”, “C N MMP2” and “C MDM2”. The labels mean the genes VEGFA, MMP2 and MDM2 from the target gene set of the cancers (C) associated co-function module can be mapped to the Bladder cancer pathway. For the non-cancer diseases (N), only two genes (VEGFA and MMP2) can be mapped to this pathway. Those genes that cannot map to any pathways or those diseases that are not associated with all of the three co-functional pairs are ignored in the figure. The cancer related gene sets can be mapped to many different pathways, we just show the top ten pathways according to their p-values.
Fig. 4The miR-29a-miR-29b-miR-29c co-function module, their targets and the enrichment analysis of the KEGG pathways. The triangles are the potential common target genes of the miR-29a/b/c co-functional module. Those small squares are the genes enriched pathways. Those disease names in the big squares are the co-functional module related diseases according to our prioritization method

        It is uncovered that the co-functional module mainly dysregulates the ‘hsa05219: Bladder cancer’ and the ‘hsa05200: Pathways in cancer’ to contribute to the development of the 13 non-cancer diseases. The module also regulates eight other pathways (hsa05205, hsa04510, hsa04066, hsa04151, hsa04150, hsa04210, hsa05161 and hsa05215) to involve in the development of the 26 cancers. The cancer developments are more complex with more common genes involved. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that similar diseases may be related to similar miRNAs and genes. The top three non-cancer disease genes regulated by the co-functional module and mapped to the pathways are MMP2, VEGFA and CASP8, while for the cancers are BCL2, MDM2 and VEGFA. With the gene ontology enrichment analysis, we found that the former three genes have the function of angiogenesis (GO:0001525, p-value=1.8E-4), macrophage differentiation (GO:0030225, p-value=2.1E-3), negative regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process (GO:0043154, p-value=9.0E-3) and response to hypoxia(GO:0001666, p-value=2.2E-2). The latter three genes can play roles of cellular response to hypoxia (GO:0071456, p-value=5.2E-5), response to iron ion (GO:0010039, p-value=2.4E-3), ovarian follicle development (GO:0001541, p-value=5.8E-3) and the other related functions. The co-functional module can regulate two same pathways during the development of both the cancers and non-cancer diseases. The possible common targets also have the similar function such as response to hypoxia. These indicate that the miR-29a/b/c regulation module may contribute to the disease development partly via similar dysregulation mechanism. On the other side, the co-functional module may prefer to function by dysregulating the same genes in the development of various cancers rather than those non-cancer diseases. During the carcinogenesis of 26 kinds of cancers, averagely more than 70% of those cancers relate to the dysfunction of the above three genes (BCL2, MDM2 and VEGFA). For the three non-cancer diseases related genes (MMP2, VEGFA and CASP8), the percentage is just around 30%. Those cancers related genes are more likely to involve in the same pathways which indicates the close relationships between their functions. This is mainly due to the fact that cancers are more similar to each other than those non-cancer diseases.
        Interestingly, there are a number of literature which have reported the co-function of the miR-29 family members in the development of the cancers such as non-small-cell lung cancer [39], renal cell carcinoma [40], breast cancer [41], ovarian cancer [42] and others types of cancers [43]. Furthermore, the MYC-mediated miR-29 repression mechanism for the therapy of aggressive B-cell malignancies (B-cell malignancies is the synonym of chronic lymphocytic leukemia according to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) [44]) by applying the HDAC3 and EZH2 as therapeutic targets [45] was reported. Another report in 2015 also discussed the adoption of miR-29s (miR-29a/b/c) as candidate epi-therapeutics for curing hematologic malignancies [46]. According to our findings and literature, we can claim that it is reasonable to consider miR-29a/b/c as potential drug targets for the treatment of multiple cancers.
      
      
        The predicted miRNAs that are related to breast and prostate cancer: case studies
        In this section, we report details of the predicted miRNAs which are likely related to breast cancer and prostate cancer. Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all women cancer patients [47]. Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men [47]. We have taken the following three steps for this case study: (1) the prediction model was trained on the RLSMDA data set of disease-miRNA associations [26] which contains 1184 disease-miRNA associations; (2) the prediction model was applied to make predictions for those disease-miRNA pairs whose relationships were unknown in this data set; (3) the positively predicted disease-miRNA pairs were evaluated using the latest version of databases such as miRCancer [33], miR2Disease [17] and HMDD [18], which stores newer disease-miRNA associations than the RLSMDA data set does. In fact, the RLSMDA data set stores only 78 and 34 miRNAs associated with breast cancer and prostate cancer respectively. However, the latest version of the three databases stores 227 and 152 miRNAs which have been found related to breast and prostate cancer. Thus, our predicted results can be fairly verified by the literature ground truth. As some of the predicted disease-miRNA associations were not covered by the three databases, we also searched other web sources to confirm the prediction results.
        We constructed 100 prediction models (for making reliable predictions), each time using all the 1184 disease-miRNA pairs as the positive samples and a set of randomly selected 1184 negative samples from the negative_expression data set (a data set of 4638 negative samples based on the analysis of expression data). If a unknown cancer-miRNA relationship is positively predicted by all the 100 models, then a strong association exists between the cancer and the miRNA. The association probabilities derived by the 100 models is averaged to indicate the strong association. Figure 5 shows the 30 top-ranked positively predicted miRNAs related to breast and prostate cancer in terms of the average probabilities of the 100 models for the miRNAs. The edges at the (a) part represent the breast cancer-miRNA associations while the edges at the (b) part show the prostate cancer-miRNA associations. The labels on these edges represent the ranking positions and evidence type of the prediction results. The characters “*”, “#” or “$” stand for that the corresponding associations can be confirmed by the records in the miR2Disease database, the HMDD database or the miRCancer database respectively. The character “@” means that the association can be confirmed by other articles. Otherwise, the predicted associations could not be confirmed to our best knowledge. Overall, 58 of the 60 predicted disease-miRNA relationships can be verified by the newer databases or by other literature work.

The part a shows the predicted breast cancer related miRNAs and the part b gives the predict prostate cancer related miRNAs. The labels of the edges illustrate the rank of the predicted associations and the confirming types. The characters “*”, “#” or “$” stand for that the corresponding associations can be confirmed by the records in miR2Disease, HMDD or miRCancer respectively. The character “@” means that the association can be confirmed by other articles. A co-functional pair miR-195-5p-miR-15b-5p is highlighted

        Figure 6
a shows the percentages of the predicted disease-miRNA associations that can be verified when the number of top-ranked miRNAs varies from 10 to 150. The x-axis is the number of predictions (× 10) while the y-axis is the percentages of the verified predictions. For the first 10 to 50 predicted miRNAs associated with breast cancer or prostate cancer, 100 and 96% of them can be verified by the three newer databases or literature. The percentages drop to 98 and 88% when we assess on the first 100 predicted associations. This indicates that a more reliable predicted disease associated miRNAs can be ranked at a higher position by our method.

Panel a introduces the prediction performance of the model with the known cancer (breast and prostate cancer) related miRNAs. Panel b shows the prediction performance after the removal of the existing associations. The x-axis is the number of predictions (× 10) while the y-axis is the percentages of the verified predictions

        A novel association predicted by our method is about hsa-miR-15b (mapped as hsa-miR-15b-5p by miRBase) and breast cancer. Hsa-miR-15b is ranked as the 5th leading breast cancer related miRNA. This miRNA is an epidermal growth factor induced miRNA, and its association with breast cancer has not been recorded by any existing databases. However, a new discovery in 2015 can verify that there is an inverse correlation between the high expression of miRNA-15b and the low expression of its target gene MTSS1 in the tissues of breast cancer patients with the aggressive basal subtype [48]. The growth factor-inducible miRNAs can mediate the mechanisms underlying the progression of breast cancer. Another novel association predicted by our method is about hsa-miR-29c (mapped as hsa-miR-29c-3p by miRBase) and prostate cancer. This association is also ranked at the 5th position among the predicted prostate cancer related miRNAs, but it has not been recorded by any existing databases. A recent report claimed that miR-29c together with other five miRNAs such as miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-26a, miR-26b and miR-218 can control the expression of metastasis-promoting LOXL2 gene during the development of prostate cancer [49].
        For the association miR-20b-prostate cancer which cannot be verified, Moltzahn et al. [50] had reported an upregulation of miR-20b in prostate cancer patients comparing with the healthy samples. However, this upregulation was not statistically significant at the follow-up PCR experiments. With our prediction, there may be an association between miR-20b and prostate cancer.
        For some diseases, there have no currently known associations with any miRNAs. To test whether our prediction algorithm is still applicable for such situations, we conducted another experiment. In the experiment, we removed all the known miRNA associations with breast cancer or prostate cancer from the RLSMDA data set. The objective was to see whether our model can correctly predict these purposely removed and currently known breast cancer-miRNA or prostate cancer-miRNA associations. The prediction results are shown in Figure 6
b. Our model has a superior performance for predicting disease-miRNA associations even when there is no known association for these two cancers. Of the top 50 predicted disease-miRNA associations, all the predicted breast cancer-miRNA associations can be confirmed by the existing databases or literature, while 96% of the top 50 predicted prostate cancer-miRNA associations can be confirmed. The confirmation rates for the top-100 predicted associations can still maintain at a very high level. Moreover, the breast cancer-hsa-miR-15b-5p and the prostate cancer-hsa-miR-29c-3p can still be predicted and ranked highly. More details of the predicted and verified disease-miRNA pairs can be found in Additional file 2: Table S3–S6. The code in the Additional file 3 which implements our prediction algorithm has a default setting to output no more than 100 miRNAs for a given disease.
      
      
        Performance comparison: prediction of disease-miRNA relationships by different methods
        A number of methods have been proposed to make predictions of unknown disease-miRNA relationships. We compared the performance of our prediction method with three state-of-the-art methods: RLSMDA [26], the method proposed by Xu et al. [28], and Jiang’s method [29]. RLSMDA is a semi-supervised method that does not need any negative samples. Xu’s method is a supervised approach and it collects the negative samples according to tissue-specific and expression properties of the miRNAs. Jiang’s method is also a supervised method. It has utilized a set of 270 negative samples randomly selected from the un-connected disease-miRNA pairs of a miRNA-disease bipartite network.
        We first optimized our prediction model with two experiments such as selecting optimal precomputed kernel matrix and determining the best size of the negative samples comparing to positive ones during the training of our model. The results illustrate that our model can achieve best performance with the following settings: applying the squared root type of precomputed kernel matrix, setting the weight parameter α=0.8 and selecting the same size of negative samples as positive samples. In addition, we did the permutation test [29] which has proved that the performance of our prediction model was not produced occasionally but contains biological significance. The performances of our model with negative samples selected from our collected negative sample set or from all the un-connected pairs were compared. Selection of negative samples from our negative sample set has been proved to be a better choice. More detail of these procedures and the results can be found in the contents and Additional file 2: Figure S1–S3.
        The source codes of these above three literature methods were not available. We implemented the RLSMDA algorithm, but not the complicated Xu’s or Jiang’s method. It is not possible for us to compare various methods with a independent test set. For a fair comparison, their data sets and performance metrics (specificity, recall(or sensitivity), precision, accuracy and AUC) were exactly used by our method. More details of the implementation and data sets are described in Additional file 2, the positive samples are listed in Additional file 4.
        The specificity, recall, accuracy and AUC performances are benchmarked in Table 2 (those values of Xu’s method and Jiang’s method were obtained from their published papers). The ROC curve of our method is depicted in Fig. 7 in comparison with the curve of the RLSMDA method under the same data set and the same leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The ROC curves for the comparison of our methods with all the three methods are also showed in Additional file 2: Figure S4–S6. Our prediction model achieves much better AUC values than the three state-of-the-art methods. This is the main reason why our prediction method was used to predict unknown miRNA-disease associations and the top-ranked ones were added to reconstruct the disease-gene-miRNA tripartite networks. The superior performance of our prediction method is mainly attributed to the careful selection of reliable negative samples as well as the precomputed kernel matrix which can identify more positive samples.
Fig. 7The ROC curves of our model compared with RLSMDA based on the same positive samples. The comparison is based on the same positive sample set and the different prediction model of RLSMDA and our newly designed model. The average AUC value of our model is 0.9896 while the RLSMDA obtains the lower value of 0.9475

      Discussion
      A more challenging problem is to detect and prioritize multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA groups containing more than two members. An intuitive approach is to integrate all the co-functional pairs that overlap. As the co-function of more than two miRNAs is rarely reported by the literature, it is hard to validate the existence of multi-miRNA co-functional groups. The prioritization of multi-miRNA co-functional groups is one of our future research topics.
      As demonstrated, our method has a much better performance for the prediction of disease-gene associations. A key idea of our method is the use of reliable negative samples screened and obtained through the fold change information of miRNA expressions. An alternative approach to the screening can be through pairwise test statistics. Combining expression fold change and pairwise test statistics may lead to decreasing the false positives in the set of negative samples. In the future work, we will examine the trade-off between the performance improvement and the quadratic pairwise time complexity.
      Multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs are also linked to the concept of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) [51, 52] which covers the regulation relationships of miRNAs and their targets including both mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. Characteristics of miRNAs in the ceRNA networks can be considered to analyze the co-functions of miRNAs. For instance, if two miRNAs are involved in the same ceRNA network, they may always co-function with each other.
    
    
      Conclusion
      We have conducted a cross disease analysis of co-functional miRNA pairs on a reconstructed disease-gene-miRNA tripartite network. We made the following contributions: (1) We proposed a new idea for selecting reliable negative samples of disease-miRNA relationship which can overcome the problem of lacking negative samples for machine learning methods to make reliable predictions of disease-associated miRNAs; (2) Our prediction model does not need to do feature selection, and it is applicable for large scale prediction of disease-associated miRNAs; (3) Our prediction model can work well for those miRNAs that have no currently known miRNA-disease associations; (4) We designed a scoring function to prioritize the candidate multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs and their potential co-regulated genes; (5) We performed detailed case studies to understand the miRNA co-functional phenomenon for both cancers and non-cancer diseases; and (6) We performed deep case studies to reveal novel associations between miRNAs and breast cancer and those between miRNAs and prostate cancer. It can be concluded that our prediction method has a superior performance for the prediction of unknown miRNA-disease associations, and that the integration of the top-ranked ones into the existing database is useful and effective for the cross disease analysis of co-functional miRNA pairs.
    
    
      Methods
      Our method for the detection and prioritization of co-functional miRNA pairs and cross disease analysis includes three main computational steps: (i) Reconstructing the DGR tripartite network by combining the known relationships of diseases, miRNAs, and genes with those predicted disease-miRNA associations, (ii) Ranking the candidate co-functional miRNA pairs via a novel scoring method, (iii) Determining the potential co-functional target genes of these co-functional miRNA pairs. Details of these steps and data sets are described in the following subsections.
      
        Data sets for the diseases, miRNAs and their related genes
        Diseases and miRNAs stored at different databases may have different names or IDs. To deal with this inconsistency issue, we mapped the names of the diseases and miRNAs from all the relevant databases to the database Disease Ontology (DO) [53] and miRBase v21.0 [54]. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) [44] and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) [55] were used as the dictionaries of the disease names. We searched in DO for all the disease names of a data set. When exact terms were found in DO, the names and the DO ids were recorded and stored in a separate file. Otherwise, we searched in MeSH and CTD, and used their synonyms to map them to DO terms. To map the names of the miRNAs, we searched the given ids of the miRNAs in miRBase v21. When a term was not found, then it was discarded (according to miRBase, it may be a dead record because it is not a miRNA, or the record has been replaced by another one). A miRNA id is always related to two mature miRNA ids with the suffix of ‘-5p’ or ‘-3p’ which means a precursor miRNA will generate two mature miRNAs from the 5’-arm or the 3’-arm respectively. As the mature miRNAs are the real functional parts, the miRNAs from different resources were mapped to the mature miRNA ids in miRBase v21. For those older version ids, we also mapped them to the current mature miRNA ids according to the term of Previous IDs of the miRBase database. Finally, each miRNA was mapped to one mature miRNA id of the database miRBase v21.
        The genes were mapped to the entrez gene ids according to the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [56]. To get the disease-related genes, we downloaded the supplementary files of [57] which contains 117,190 associations between 2817 diseases and 12063 genes from the database SIDD [58]. After data correction and redundancy removal, we obtained a data set of 114754 disease-gene associations between 2802 diseases and 10893 genes. To get the target genes of those miRNAs, we searched two databases: miRecords [19] and miRTarBase [20]. After mapping the miRNAs to miRBase v21 and mapping the gene names to entrez gene ids, we retrieved 322,269 miRNA-target pairs between 2588 miRNAs and 14794 genes. We list these disease genes and miRNA targets in Additional files 5 and 6 for more details.
      
      
        Positive samples and negative samples for training the prediction model to identify unknown disease-miRNA associations
        There are several disease-miRNA databases such as miR2Disease [17], HMDD [18], and miRCancer [33]. This work focuses on the human mature miRNAs. The database HMDD stores the miRNAs as the precursor miRNA ids, these ids were first converted into mature miRNA ids according to the provided reference links before mapping them to the mature miRNA ids. After mapping the miRNAs and diseases to miRBase v21 and DO respectively, we retrieved 4578 associations between 463 miRNAs and 263 diseases from HMDD, 1952 associations between 83 cancers and 341 miRNAs from miRCancer, and 2096 disease-miRNA associations between 108 diseases and 287 miRNAs from miR2Disease. These are known disease-miRNA associations and they are used as the positive samples for the training of the prediction model.
        Selection of negative samples, i.e., those disease-miRNA pairs that have little associations, is a difficult problem. We explored a novel idea to select credible negative samples. The new idea is to select negative samples according to the expression data of the miRNAs that we downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [59]. We computed the fold changes of the miRNAs in the diseased patients comparing with the controls (i.e., the adjacent normal cells or the healthy contributor’s corresponding cells) according to the given platform information of the GEO database. A disease-related miRNA is always differentially expressed significantly between these two groups of subjects. Those miRNAs that are not significant differential expressed (the fold changes smaller than 0.05) will be regarded as non-disease related miRNAs. After conducting analysis on 78 GSE accessions (some accessions without enough information for compute the fold changes were removed), we determined 21432 disease-miRNA pairs between 2473 miRNAs and 73 diseases which have little association. The accession ids can be found in the Additional file 7. By comparing this data set of negative samples with the above HMDD-based, miRCancer-based and the miR2Disease-based positive data sets, those pairs that appeared in both of the negative data set and the positive data sets were discarded. We then obtained 4041, 1838 and 1487 disease-miRNA pairs respectively from HMDD,miRCancer and miR2Disease, which were regarded as positive samples. 20772 disease-miRNA pairs extracted by the analysis of the GSE accessions were used as negative samples. To obtain more reliable negative samples, we also removed those diseases that have no known related miRNAs and those miRNAs that have no known related diseases according to the three positive data sets from the 20772 disease-miRNA pairs. Finally, there are 4638 negative samples involving 53 diseases and 538 miRNAs. All these four data sets are further described in Additional file 8.
        We note that Jiang’s method [29] takes all those unknown disease-miRNA pairs as negative samples and constructed balanced data sets by a random selection of a subset of the negative samples as the same size of the verified disease-miRNA associations. Xu’s method [28] takes those miRNAs at the lowest expression levels in the normal tissue as negative samples. Our method for selecting negative samples is different and more convincing as we consider the fold changes of the expression levels of the miRNAs between diseased and control tissues.
      
      
        Precomputed kernel matrices for the support vector machine
        We applied support vector machine (SVM) to predict disease-related miRNAs. SVM is a supervised learning model for classification and regression [60]. We adopted the LibSVM version 3.20 [61] in this work. Usually, one can extract the features of the samples as the input of SVM to implement classification or regression with different kernel functions such as linear kernel, polynomial kernel, radial basis function kernel. However, even though we can represent a miRNA as a feature vector, it is hard to design an appropriate feature vector to describe a disease. Diseases are always phenotypes of patients. It is difficult to find the common properties of diseases that can be normalized as mathematical variables. To overcome this issue, we proposed to use precomputed kernel matrices instead of constructing the feature vectors to represent the disease-miRNA pairs. Construction of a precomputed kernel matrix has three main steps:
        
Step 1: Calculate the difference between two disease-miRNA pairs. Given two disease-miRNA pairs d

        Measuring the pairwise similarities of diseases or miRNAs
        Disease similarity between two diseases, denoted by DisSim, is measured in two parts: the disease semantic similarity (SemSim) and the functional similarity between disease-related gene sets (FunSim). The multiplication of SemSim and FunSim is defined as DisSim. The definition of FunSim is referred to the SemFunSim method [57]. We implemented the algorithm and obtained the FunSim measurements between 2802 diseases. The SemSim was computed with the R package DOSE [62]. For the DOSE, we applied Resnik’s [63] definition of the common ancestor for two given terms. To avoid too many zero values of the similarities, we integrated SemSim and FunSim using a sum (instead of multiplication) and a weight parameter α. The new similarity measurement between disease d
i and disease d
j is computed by

        MiRNA similarity between two miRNAs, denoted by MiRSim is also measured in two parts: the sequence similarity (SeqSim) and the function similarity (funSim). SeqSim evaluates the similarity of the two miRNA sequences. We applied the idea of pseudo amino acid composition [64] to represent a miRNA as a (4+λ)-dimension vector. This idea was originally proposed to represent protein sequences as vectors.
        Given a RNA sequence R:r

        Among all the datasets we mentioned previously, 551 different mature miRNAs were involved. Thus, we obtained the similarities between these 551 miRNAs in this work (details of the miRNAs and their targets listed in Additional file 6). Together with the similarities between 2802 diseases (details of the disease-gene associations listed in Additional file 5), these plenty of similarity information provide us adequate data to investigate associations between diseases and miRNAs.
      
      
        Scoring the multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pairs
        This work defines a multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pair as a pair of miRNAs that can dysregulate the same gene or whose target genes are involved in the same cellular processes to participate in the development of a series of diseases. Such a miRNA pair has three good properties: (i) the members function cooperatively, which means they prefer to share the same targets; (ii) the members are associated with the development of a same set of diseases; and (iii) the common miRNA targets of the two miRNAs are potentially to be the common disease genes of their related diseases. These three properties can be examined on a DGR tripartite network containing various associations between miRNAs, diseases and genes.
        Let d

g∪V
r,E) be a DGR tripartite network, where V
d is a set of diseases, V

        MiRNA pairs related to bigger number of diseases are more likely to reflect the general regulation mechanism. Thus, a threshold is set to control the number of diseases that the pair is associated with. There is no reliable data set for us to select an optimal threshold, we just set the threshold to be 10. We can then rank all the candidate co-functional miRNA pairs according to their cfScores. A higher position indicates the pair is more likely to be a multi-disease associated co-functional miRNA pair.
        Usually, the two members of a co-functional miRNA pair can share more than one common targets. However, only part of them are really dysregulated by the miRNA pair during the development of the diseases (called the co-functional targets of this co-functional miRNA pair). As all those miRNAs shared targets can be candidate co-functional target, a probability is estimated for the candidate co-functional targets to be the exact dysregulated genes during the diseases’ developments. The idea is that the candidate co-functional targets being the disease genes for more of the miRNA pair associated diseases are more likely to be the real ones. We calculate the probability of gene g
i,p(g
i), to be a co-functional target by:

        Women diagnosed with breast cancer within 5 years of childbirth have poorer prognosis than nulliparous or pregnant women. Weaning-induced breast involution is implicated, as the collagen-rich, immunosuppressive microenvironment of the involuting mammary gland is tumor promotional in mice. To investigate the role of mammary fibroblasts, isolated mammary PDGFRα+ cells from nulliparous and postweaning mice were assessed for activation phenotype and protumorigenic function. Fibroblast activation during involution was evident by increased expression of fibrillar collagens, lysyl oxidase, Tgfb1, and Cxcl12 genes. The ability of mammary tumors to grow in an isogenic, orthotopic transplant model was increased when tumor cells were coinjected with involution-derived compared with nulliparous-derived mammary fibroblasts. Mammary tumors in the involution-fibroblast group had increased Ly6C+ monocytes at the tumor border, and decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and tumor cell death. Ibuprofen treatment suppressed involution-fibroblast activation and tumor promotional capacity, concurrent with decreases in tumor Ly6C+ monocytes, and increases in intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration, granzyme levels, and tumor cell death. In total, our data identify a COX/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)–dependent activated mammary fibroblast within the involuting mammary gland that displays protumorigenic, immunosuppressive activity, identifying fibroblasts as potential targets for the prevention and treatment of postpartum breast cancer.
      
        
          Background
          The pathological mechanism of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is still unclear. In the present study, pathway cross-talks were analyzed to identify hub pathways for BE, with the purpose of finding an efficient and cost-effective detection method to discover BE at its early stage and take steps to prevent its progression.
        
        
          Material/Methods
          We collected and preprocessed gene expression profile data, original pathway data, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Then, we constructed a background pathway cross-talk network (BPCN) based on the original pathway data and PPI data, and a disease pathway cross-talk network (DPCN) based on the differential pathways between the PPI data and the BE and normal control. Finally, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on these 2 networks to identify hub pathway cross-talks for BE, so as to better understand the pathological mechanism of BE from the pathway level.
        
        
          Results
          A total of 12 411 genes, 300 pathways (6919 genes), and 787 896 PPI interactions (16 730 genes) were separately obtained from their own databases. Then, we constructed a BPCN with 300 nodes (42 293 interactions) and a DPCN with 296 nodes (15 073 interactions). We identified 4 hub pathways: AMP signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and osteoclast differentiation. We found that these pathways might play important roles during the occurrence and development of BE.
        
        
          Conclusions
          We predicted that these pathways (such as AMP signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway) could be used as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapy of BE.
        
      
    
      Background
      Barrett’s esophagus (BE, also known as columnar-lined esophagus), is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease and a precursor lesion in most cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) [1]. Although, less than 5% of patients with BE will go on to develop EA, it is generally accepted that most persons with BE are undiagnosed and the vast majority of EA occurs in patients with undiagnosed BE [2]. EA usually carries a poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15% [3]. Endoscopic examination is the now most commonly used means for detection of early EA, but is neither feasible nor cost-effective [4]; therefore, there is great need for an efficient and cost-effective method to detect BE in the early stage to prevent progression.
      Recent efforts have been made to better understand the occurrence and development of BE. It has been reported that increasing age, cigarette smoking, obesity, lack of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are the leading risk factors for BE [5]. In addition, the intestinal epithelial-associated caudal-type homeobox (CDX) transcription factors CDX1 and CDX2 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BE [6]. By using next-generation sequencing in endoscopic biopsies, ARID1A has been identified as a tumor-suppressor gene in BE [7]. Furthermore, the genomic sequences have been discovered [8]. However, the exact pathological mechanism still remains unclear.
      At present, pathway analysis has become the first choice for extracting and explaining the underlying biology for high-throughput molecular measurements [9]. One effective biological approach to identifying pathway interaction is through genetic screenings, in which synthetic lethality of 2 mutations often indicates interaction between 2 pathways where those 2 mutations reside separately [10]. Given the complex nature of biological systems, pathways often need to function in a coordinated fashion to produce appropriate physiological responses to internal and external stimuli [11]. Fortunately, background pathway cross-talk network (BPCN) provides a quantifiable description of the molecular networks that characterize the complex interactions and the intricate interwoven relationships that govern cellular functions, among those tissues and disease-related genes to explain the molecular processes during disease development and progression [12]. In networks, 2 pathways are likely to interact with or influence each other (cross-talk) if significantly more protein interactions are detected between these 2 pathways than expected by chance. Therefore, in the present study, pathway cross-talk analysis was conducted based on the networks of BPCN and disease pathway cross-talk network (DPCN) to identify the key pathways for BE, so as to better understand the exact pathogenesis of BE.
      Therefore, we collected and preprocessed gene expression profile data, pathway data, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Next, we separately constructed a BPCN and a DPCN. Finally, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on these 2 networks to identify key pathway cross-talks for BE. The results are potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapy of BE, which could give great insights to reveal the pathological mechanism underlying this disease, or contribute to future study of related diseases.
    
    
      Material and Methods
      
        Data recruitment and preprocessing
        
          Gene expression profile data
          The gene expression profile of BE, with accessing number of GSE39491 (8), was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The data on GSE39491, on the A-AFFY-37 – Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 platform, were composed of 40 BE samples and 80 controls from matched normal mucosa. The microarray data and annotation files were downloaded. Then, the gene expression profile on probe level was converted into gene symbol level, and the duplicated symbols were deleted. Finally, a total of 12 411 gene symbols was obtained for further analysis.
        
        
          Pathway data recruiting
          Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information [13]. The KEGG pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg) is a collection of graphical diagrams (pathway maps) for the biochemical pathways [14]. In this study, all human pathway data were downloaded from the KEGG pathway database, and a total of 300 pathways and 6919 genes were obtained.
        
        
          Protein interaction data recruitment and preprocessing
          There are several PPI databases that researchers commonly use, such as the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) [15], BioGRID [16], Reactome [17], and the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) [18]. In the present study, the global human PPIs were obtained from the STRING database (http://string-db.org/), which included a total of 1 048 576 interactions. The protein IDs were converted into gene symbol level, and the duplicated symbols were deleted. Finally, a PPI network including a total of 787 896 interactions (16 730 genes) were obtained for further analysis.
        
      
      
        BPCN construction
        To evaluate interactions among pathways, the PPI relationship between the pathways, which was pathway cross-talk, was investigated. The pathways that had cross-talk between each other were selected to construct the network, which was defined as the BPCN. First, for each of the pathway pairs that we obtained from the KEGG pathway database, the PPI analysis of the genes enriched in these 2 pathways were conducted. After statistically analyzing all of the pathway pairs and all of the interactions between any 2 pathway pairs, we separately denoted these numbers as weight values for the pathway pairs. Then, we used the Fisher exact test to evaluate gene overlap between any given pair of pathways [19], and P-values (denoted as PB) were adjusted by false discovery rate (FDR) [20]. Finally, the BPCN was visualized by Cytoscape with pathway pairs whose adjusted PB were <0.05.
      
      
        DPCN construction
        To further explore the relationships among the pathways in BE, a pathway cross-talk network was constructed based on the gene expression profile and the PPIs, and we denoted this network as the DPCN. In the present study, there were 2 steps for constructing the DPCN: pathway analysis for BE and DPCN construction.
        
          Pathway analysis for BE
          In the present study, to gain further insights into the functional enrichment of the genes of the BE, pathway analysis was performed on the gene expression profile. There were 2 steps in this analysis. First, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted based on the KEGG pathway database [13]. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [21] was used to perform the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the nodes to find the biochemical pathways which might be involved in the occurrence and development of BE. The pathways with gene counts including more than 5 genes and less than 100 genes were selected for further analysis. Then, GSEA-ANOVA of the attract method was used to test pathway-level data to identify the values of the F-statistic, and the t test with Welch modification was used to adjust the P value [22]. In this case, each pathway was assigned a P value, which we denoted as PA, and these pathways were ranked in descending order according to their PA.
        
        
          DPCN construction
          In the present study, the DPCN was constructed based on the differential pathways. To further define the relationships of these pathways identified above, the PPI relationships between every pathway cross-talk were measured. For any pathway cross-talk, we went through all genes in a given pathway, and if a gene did not have any interaction, we skipped it. If a gene had interaction, the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) (23) was utilized to weight pairwise interactions of BE and normal controls in pathways. The SCC of a pair of interactions (x and y) was defined as:

          For any pathway cross-talk, supposing that there were A and B genes in these 2 pathways, respectively, we defined the weight of the pathway pairs as the total absolute different value of SCC between normal controls and BE divided (X × Y).
          In the following, we used the Fisher exact test [19] to evaluate gene overlap between any given pathway cross-talk, and P-values, which we denoted as PD, were adjusted by FDR [20]. Finally, the pathway pairs of BE and normal controls whose adjusted PD <0.05 were considered as differential pathways were selected to construct a DPCN via Cytoscape.
        
      
      
        Identification of hub pathways
        For purposes of identifying hub pathways for BE, a general analysis was conducted on the BPCN and DPCN. Centrality analysis was employed to investigate biological functions and significance of hub cross-talks in BPCN and DPCN. Centrality measures mainly contain degree [24], closeness [25], betweenness [26], and transitivity [27], in which degree is the simplest topological index. In the present study, the pathways of the BPCN and DPCN were ranked in descending order according to the degree centralities of the pathways.
        Then, the rank product (RP) algorithm [28], a simple but powerful meta-analysis tool to detect differentially expressed genes between 2 experimental conditions, was used to analyze these 2 networks. U and V stand for 2 conditions (BE vs. controls), and there were nU and nV replicates in the BPCN, and mU and mV in DPCN. The RP for each cross-talk was determined according to the following formula:
        
          
            
              
                R

        Where rsi stood for the rank of sth gene under ith comparison, i=1, …, T. The pathways with RP value <0.05 were considered to be very important and selected for further analysis.
        The impact factor (IF) was considered to determine the hub pathways. For an arbitrary pathway x, where PD represented the degree value of the DPCN, and PA represented the P value according to the attract method. The IF of pathway x was calculated according to the following formula:
        
          
            
              
                I

        Finally, based on comprehensive analysis, the pathways with PA <0.05 and RP value <0.05, as well as the top 2% pathways according to the IF values, were considered as hub pathways. The cross-talks among hub pathways were hub cross-talks.
      
    
    
      Results
      In the present study, for detecting significant biomarkers for BE, pathway cross-talk analysis was conducted. Prior to analysis, gene data, original pathway data, and PPI data were all collected from their own databases. In the following, comprehensive analysis was performed on the BPCN and DPCN to identify hub cross-talks. The results were as follow.
      
        BPCN construction
        Having obtained the pathway data and the PPI data from their own databases, the PPI relationships between any 2 pathways were analyzed. By setting the threshold value of PB <0.05, a BPCN with 300 nodes (42 293 interactions) was constructed (Figure 1). Degree centrality analysis was conducted on the BPCN (Figure 2), showing that the degree of most pathways was focused on the value between 250 and 300. In this case, most pathways were contacted with each other. Edges between 2 pathways with significant gene overlap were considered as not informative, and thus were removed from the network. Note that it was our intent to discover cross-talk among different biological activities in BE; therefore, we constructed a DPCN.

          Pathway enrichment analysis
          As indicated in the Methods section, to construct the DPCN, we first conducted KEGG enrichment analysis of the gene expression profile of BE. Then, each pathway was assigned a P value via the attract method. There were 16 pathways with PA <0.05: Chemical carcinogenesis (PA=6.49E-06), Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome (PA=2.09E-05), Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (PA=7.97E-05), Ribosome (PA=7.97E-05), Retinol metabolism (PA=7.97E-05), Drug metabolism – cytochrome (PA=1.30E-03), Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (PA=1.71E-03), RNA transport (PA=1.71E-03), ABC transporters (PA=4.79E-03), Osteoclast differentiation (PA=1.20E-02), Nicotine addiction (PA=1.20E-02), Antigen processing and presentation (PA=1.90E-02), cAMP signaling pathway (PA=2.40E-02), cGMP – PKG signaling pathway (PA=2.40E-02), Valine (PA=2.40E-02), and Spliceosome (PA=2.40E-02).
        
        
          DPCN construction
          To further define the biological activities of the pathways of the BE, a DPCN was constructed based on the differential pathways. As SCC was used to weight the pairwise interactions of BE and normal controls in pathways, the Fisher exact test was utilized to evaluate gene overlap between any given pathway cross-talk, and FDR was used to adjust the P value. By setting the cutoff value of PD <0.05, 296 differential pathways were identified. In this case, a DPCN with 296 nodes (15 073 interactions), where each node represented a pathway, was built (Figure 3). Then, degree centrality analysis was conducted on the DPCN (Figure 4), showing that the degree values were scattered and distributed dispersedly from 0 to 200, which was smaller than that in BPCN. This might be useful in exploring different cross-talks between BE and normal controls.
        
      
      
        Identification of hub pathways
        To detect differentially expressed genes between BE and the normal control condition, an RP algorithm was implemented to perform analysis on these 2 networks. Under the threshold value of RP <0.05, we obtained a total of 55 pathways. The IF values of the pathways were calculated and ranked in descending order, and we obtained 6 pathways: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (IF=186), Osteoclast differentiation (IF=157), cAMP signaling pathway (IF=156), Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (IF=147), cGMP - PKG signaling pathway (IF=137), and Epstein-Barr virus infection (IF=135). Finally, 4 hub pathways – cAMP signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and Osteoclast differentiation – were identified under the threshold values of PA <0.05 and RP value <0.05, as well as the top 2% pathways according to the IF values. The details are listed in Table 1, and these 4 hub pathways were regarded to play key roles in BE. The hub cross-talks are shown in Figure 5.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      BE is an acquired condition in which the normal stratified squamous epithelium in the distal esophagus is replaced by metaplastic columnar epithelium in response to chronic gastroesophageal reflux [29], with a predisposition to EA. Better understanding of the molecular alterations during its development might improve prevention and tumor control and ultimately lead to better disease management. High-throughput biological experiments that interrogate many genes simultaneously have generated unprecedented amounts of data. Bioinformatics methods have been accepted as quick and efficient methods for analyzing these huge amounts of data, providing a preliminary understanding of the disease. Pathway analysis has become the first choice for gaining insight into the underlying biology of genes and proteins, as it reduces complexity and has increased explanatory power [30]. Traditional methods often pay close attention to diagnostic or prognostic markers, usually obtained by identification of the most significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the case-control and the disease [31], then pathway analysis is conducted on the DEGs to disclose the significant differential pathways between the disease and the normal control conditions. However, studies showed that the most significant DEGs obtained from different studies for a particular disease are typically inconsistent [32]. The cross-validation of datasets, such as network-based methods, significantly reduce those false findings and increase sensitivity [33]. Moreover, by utilizing pathway-related networks, one can gain insights into the mechanism by which biological systems operate [34].
      Therefore, in this research, we conducted analysis on BE via integrating biological pathways and protein interaction data. We found that pathways of cAMP signaling pathway, cGMP – PKG signaling pathway, Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and Osteoclast differentiation showed significant differences between BE condition and normal control condition. Therefore, to further define the relationship between the altered pathways and BE, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the altered pathways, and cAMP signaling pathway used as an example.
      Pathway analysis has been conducted to disclose the molecular mechanisms underlying BE [35–37]. It has been reported that a brief exposure to acid induces MAPK activation in vitro in human Barrett’s-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma cells and in vivo in the metaplastic esophageal mucosa of patients with BE [35]. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has tissue- specific effects on growth, differentiation, and gene expression [38]. cAMP has been found to activate MAPK and Elk-1 through a B-Raf- and Rap1-dependent pathway [39]. Furthermore, it has been reported that there is significant cross-talk between cAMP and MAPK signaling in the regulation of cell proliferation. In the present study, the cAMP signaling pathway was considered to be significant for EB. Therefore, we predict that there might be a relationship between cAMP signaling pathway and BE. In the future, further experimental verification should be conducted to verify the relationship between the cAMP signaling pathway and BE.
    
    
      Conclusions
      We identified several hub pathways (cAMP signaling pathway, cGMP – PKG signaling pathway, Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and Osteoclast differentiation) for BE via integrating biological pathways and protein interaction data. We predict that these pathways might play key roles during the occurrence and development of BE, and are potentially novel predictive and prognostic markers for BE.
    
  
        Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been implicated in multiple malignant tumors, and HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) exert anti-cancer effects. However, the expression of HDACs and the anti-tumor mechanism of HDACIs in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that expression of HDACs 2, 3, and 8 were up-regulated in CCA tissues and those patients with high expression of HDAC2 and/or HDAC3 had a worse prognosis. In CCA cells, two HDACIs, trichostatin (TSA) and vorinostat (SAHA), suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis and G2/M cycle arrest. Microarray analysis revealed that TACC3 mRNA was down-regulated in CCA cells treated with TSA. TACC3 was highly expressed in CCA tissues and predicted a poor prognosis in CCA patients. TACC3 knockdown induced G2/M cycle arrest and suppressed the invasion, metastasis, and proliferation of CCA cells, both in vitro and in vivo. TACC3 overexpression reversed the effects of its knockdown. These findings suggest TACC3 may be a useful prognostic biomarker for CCA and is a potential therapeutic target for HDACIs.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) originates from the epithelial cells of the intra- and extra-hepatic biliary trees and is the second most common hepatobiliary malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. Morbidity due to CCA has been rising worldwide over the past several decades [2]. Due to the strong and early invasive characteristics of CCA, most patients are diagnosed in the later stages of disease. In addition, more than two-thirds of patients are ineligible for surgery, the only potential curative option. Unfortunately, even radical resection is associated with a high rate of recurrence that results in a five-year survival rate of less than 20-40%. Most CCA patients resort to palliative treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with a response of only 10-20% [3–5]. Therefore, it is crucial to find new therapeutic strategies and an effective prognostic biomarker for patients with CCA.
      Tumor development requires both genetic and epigenetic alterations, which include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and gene silencing by small RNAs [6]. Acetylation of the N-terminal tail of core histones is tightly controlled by the antagonistic actions of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) [7]. HDACs remove acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones, increasing the ionic interactions between DNA and histones, and resulting in chromatin condensation that represses transcription [8, 9]. As a consequence, excessive deacetylation of histones induces cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell migration, and invasion by inactivating tumor suppressor genes [10]. There are eighteen HDAC isoforms categorized into four classes. Class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3 and 8) are the best characterized and are related to the yeast RPD3 deacetylase. Class II HDACs are subdivided into class IIa (HDACs 4, 5, 7 and 9) and class IIb HDACs (HDACs 6 and 10), which are homologous to the yeast Hda1 deacetylase. Class III HDACs (sirtuins [SIRTs]) include the seven subtypes of SIRTs (SIRTs 1-7), while class IV HDACs only includes HDAC11 [11–13]. Many studies have reported on the differential expression of class I and II HDAC isoforms in a variety of malignancies and cell lines, such as lymphoma [14], breast [15], gastric [16], colorectal [17], and lung cancers [18], hepatocellular carcinoma [19], as well as cholangiocarcinoma [20]. Despite the fact that class I and II HDACs are overexpressed in a variety of CCA cell lines, few studies have examined HDAC expression status and its prognostic value in CCA patients [20].
      A multitude of natural and synthetic compounds function as HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) that weaken histone-DNA interactions permitting a more open chromatin conformation and enhancing gene transcription. HDACIs as cancer treatments lead to increased transcription of tumor suppressor genes, the induction of cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, and the inhibition of angiogenesis [21, 22]. HDACIs have been classified into four groups according to their chemistry: hydroxamates (trichostatin [TSA] and vorinostat [SAHA]), cyclic peptides (romidepsin), aliphatic acids, and benzamides [21, 23]. Out of all of the HDACIs, SAHA has shown the most promising antitumor effects on tumor types at doses that are well-tolerated by patients and was the first HDACI approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [24]. TSA is a pan-HDACI and was the first natural hydroxamate found to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in many cancer cell lines, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and CCA cells [20, 21, 25]. Despite the broad application of HDACIs in cell culture, animal models, and early phase clinical trials, surprisingly little is known about specific anti-tumor mechanism of HDACIs in CCA.
      Transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein 3 (TACC3), a member of the TACC family, is encoded by the TACC3 gene, which is located on 4p16.3. TACC3 is a centrosome/microtubule-associated protein characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal coiled-coil domain [26, 27]. TACC3 regulates centrosome integrity and microtubule dynamics during mitosis, and has recently been shown to modulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathways in cervical cancer cells [28, 29]. TACC3 is also involved in the development of glioblastoma [30], multiple myeloma [31], lung cancer [32] and breast cancer [33], while TACC3 expression is decreased in thyroid and ovarian cancers [34, 35]. The function of TACC3 and its relationship with HDACIs in CCA is unknown.
      In the present study, we first investigated the expression of class I and II HDACs in CCA tissues, and then, assessed the correlation of HDAC expression with CCA patient clinicopathological characteristics. We then demonstrated that TSA and SAHA inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in CCA cell lines. In addition, through a microarray experiment, we found that TACC3 expression was down-regulated when cells were treated with HDACIs. Expression of TACC3 and its correlation with the clinicopathological features of CCA were also investigated. Moreover, the functions of TACC3 were assessed by RNA knockdown and rescue experiments, in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that HDAC2, HDAC3, and TACC3 are highly expressed in CCA tissues and that their expression correlates with poor prognosis in CCA patients. Thus, TACC3 may be a target of HDACIs, which inhibit the proliferation and migration of CCA cells.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        High expression of HDAC2 and HDAC3 promotes tumor progression and correlates with poor prognosis
        The expression of class I and class II HDAC mRNAs was assayed with qRT-PCR in 26 paired CCA and adjacent non-tumor fresh tissue samples. Among HDACs 1-10, class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8) and HDAC9 were more highly expressed in CCA tissues compared with paired non-tumor tissues (P<0.05; Figure 1A). HDAC protein expression was then assayed by Western blot (WB), and the expression of HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 were higher in CCA tissues compared with paired non-tumor tissues (P<0.05; Figure 1B). We selected HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 to further examine in 79 paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded paired CCA and adjacent non-tumor tissues with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Expression of all three HDACs was localized to the nucleus (Figure 1C), and high expression of HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8 was observed in 42 (53.16%), 44 (55.69%), and 42 (53.16%) CCA cases, respectively. CCA tissues had higher expression compared with corresponding matched non-tumor tissues (27.85%, 30.38%, and 32.91% for HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8, respectively; χ2 =10.505, 10.327, 6.609; P<0.05; Table 1). Furthermore, high expression of HDAC2 and HDAC3 was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (χ2 =15.474; 9.757) (P<0.001, P=0.002), TNM stage (χ2 =13.021; 7.693) (P<0.001, P=0.006), and differentiation (χ2 =9.125; 8.313) (P=0.003; P=0.004) in CCA; however, no such correlations were observed for HDAC8 (P>0.05; Table 1). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with low expression of HDAC2 and/or HDAC3 exhibited a longer overall survival (OS) than those with high expression of HDAC2 and/or HDAC3 (P<0.001, Figure 1D), but no correlation with OS was observed for HDAC8. Moreover, multivariate COX regression analyses identified HDAC2 and HDAC3 as significant, independent prognostic factors for OS (95%CI: 1.393-9.857, P=0.009; 95%CI: 2.419-12.575, P<0.001; Table 2), as well as for lymph node status (95%CI: 1.078-6.320, P=0.034), TNM stage (95%CI: 2.335-10.182, P=0.002), and differentiation (95%CI: 1.950-8.758, P<0.001; Table 2).

            A. qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of class I and class II HDACs in 26 paired CCA and non-tumor tissue samples. Total RNA was isolated from at least three samples of each tissue and ACTB was used as the internal control. Fold changes were calculated through relative quantification (2−ΔΔCt). Data are shown as mean ± SD, *P<0.05. B. Western blot was used to detect protein expression of HDACs 2, 3, and 8. GAPDH was used as the internal control and all experiments were repeated three times. A representative image is shown (upper panel), and the statistical analysis of the relative optical density of each band is shown (lower panel). *P<0.05. C. Representative IHC staining of HDACs 2, 3 and 8 in CCA tissues and paired adjacent non-tumor tissue (400X). Scale bar, 100μm. D. Kaplan-Meier analysis. a. Patients with low HDAC2 expression (n=37) had longer overall survival (OS) than patients with high HDAC2 expression (n=42; median OS: 40 months vs 16 months, P<0.001, log-rank test). b. Patients with low HDAC3 expression (n=35) had longer OS than patients with high HDAC3 expression (n=44; median OS: 43 months vs 17 months, P<0.001, log-rank test). c. There were no differences in OS between the low HDAC8 expression group (n=37) and the high HDAC8 expression group (n=42; median OS: 32 months vs 26 months, P=0.5893, log-rank test). d. Patients with lower expression of both HDAC2 and HDAC3 (n=21) had a longer OS than patients with higher expression of both HDAC2 and HDAC3 (n=22), or low expression of either HDAC2 or HDAC3 (n=36; median OS: 42 months vs 16 months vs 25 months, P<0.001, log-rank test).

        TSA and SAHA suppress cell proliferation, promote cell apoptosis, induce cell cycle arrest, and restrain EMT in CCA cell lines
        To investigate the anti-cancer effects of HDACIs in CCA, TSA and SAHA were used to treat the two CCA cell lines, TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 (1% DMSO treatment was used as a negative control). Both TSA and SAHA suppressed cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in CCA cells (Figure 2A). At 48 hours, the IC50 of TSA was 0.3075 μM for TFK-1 cells and 0.4718 μM for HuCCT-1 cells, while the IC50 of SAHA was 3.257 μM for TFK-1 cells and 4.603 μM for HuCCT-1 cells. Moreover, when TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells were treated with TSA and SAHA at their respective IC50 doses for 48 hours, the rate of apoptosis was higher than that of the DMSO-treated cells (P<0.05, Figure 2B). Additionally, both drugs induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in both CCA cell lines (P<0.05, Figure 2C), and the percentage of TFK-1 cells in G1 phase was also markedly decreased (P<0.05, Figure 2C). For HuCCT-1 cells, a decrease in the percentage of cells in G1 phase was only observed after treatment with TSA (P<0.05, Figure 2C). Consistent with these results, expression of the well-defined apoptosis protein marker, cleaved caspase 3, was markedly increased (P<0.05, Figure 2D), while expression of G2/M phase checkpoint proteins, including CDK1 and cyclin B1, was down-regulated after treatment with TSA or SAHA (P<0.05, Figure 2D). To detect the impact of HDACIs on EMT, we also examined the expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and the mesenchymal marker, vimentin. Elevated expression of E-cadherin and reduced expression of vimentin were detected at both the mRNA and protein level after TSA and SAHA treatment. In addition, the expression of HDAC2 and HDAC3 were down-regulated (P<0.05, Figure 2E). These results indicated that HDAC2 and HDAC3 might restrain EMT in CCA cells.

            TSA and SAHA suppress cell proliferation, promote cell apoptosis, induce cell cycle arrest, and restrain EMT in CCA cell lines
            For all experiments, TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations (IC50 values at 48 hours) of TSA (left panels) or SAHA (right panels). 1% DMSO treatment was used as a negative control and each experiment was repeated three times. Data are presented as means ± SD. A. The survival rates of TFK-1 (upper panel) and HuCCT-1 (lower panel) cells were detected by CCK-8 assay. Survival Rate % = (ODtreated − ODblank)/(ODcontrol − ODblank) × 100%. B. Apoptotic cells were analyzed by FACS via staining of annexin V. The percentage of apoptotic cells is shown (TFK-1, upper panels; HuCCT-1, lower panels; * P<0.05). C. An increased number of cells in G2/M phase was found by FACS analysis after treatment with TSA or SAHA. The percentage of TFK-1 cells in G1 phase was also markedly decreased. A decrease in the percentage of HuCCT-1 cells in G1 phase only observed after treatment with TSA (TFK-1, upper panels; HuCCT-1, lower panels; *P<0.05). D. Western blot demonstrated that the expression of the caspase 3 was increased, while the expression of the G2/M phase checkpoint proteins, CDK1 and cyclin B1, was down-regulated in TFK-1 (upper panels) and HuCCT-1 (lower panels) cells after treatment with TSA or SAHA. β-actin was used as the internal control. *P<0.05. E. qRT-PCR was used to analyze the mRNA expression of HDAC2, HDAC3, CDH1, and VIM in TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cell lines after treatment with TSA or SAHA, ACTB was used as the internal control (Left panels, *P<0.05). Western blot was used to explore protein expression of HDAC2, HDAC3, E-cadherin, and vimentin in TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cell lines after treatment with TSA or SAHA. β-actin was used as the internal control (Left panels, *P<0.05). Representative images are shown (middle panels). Statistical analysis of the relative optical density of each band is shown (right panels, *P<0.05).
          
          
        
      
      
        Identification of TACC3 as a molecular drug target of HDAC inhibitors and its correlation with poor prognosis in CCA patients
        To identify the target transcripts of HDACIs, mRNA expression profiles of TFK-1 cells treated with TSA at the IC50 dose for 48 hours, were measured via microarray analysis. TFK-1 cells treated with 1% DMSO were used as a negative controls. The microarray data have been stored in the NCBI GEO repository and are accessible through the following GEO accession number: GSE78867 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78867). In total, there were 1568 up-regulated genes and 1448 down-regulated genes identified. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) software was used to identify genes involved in cell proliferation and migration, leaving 163 genes as shown in the hierarchical clustering graph (Figure 3A). Among these genes, TACC3 mRNA was markedly down-regulated (Fold Change=6.317668; P<0.0001) after TSA treatment. To validate these findings, TACC3 mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in CCA cell lines treated with TSA or SAHA. The qRT-PCR results confirmed that TACC3 mRNA was down-regulated after treatment with HDACIs (P<0.05; Figure 3B).

            Microarray analysis indicates TACC3 as a molecular drug target of HDAC inhibitors, and the expression of TACC3 correlates with the prognosis of CCA patients
            A. Hierarchical clustering analysis of 163 mRNAs involved in cell proliferation and migration that were differentially expressed (Fold Change ≥ 2.0 and P-value ≤ 0.05) after treatment with TSA (right) compared with 1% DMSO (left), which was used as negative control. Red coloring indicates up-regulated and green indicates means down-regulated expression. B. Expression of TACC3 mRNA (upper panels) and protein (lower panels) in TFK-1 and HuCTT-1 cells was validated by qRT-PCR and WB. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TSA and SAHA (respective IC50 values at 48 hours). 1% DMSO treatment was used as negative control and β-actin was used as the internal control. These experiments were repeated three times, and data are shown as mean ± SD, *P<0.05. C. Expression of TACC3 mRNA and protein in CCA samples and adjacent non-tumor bile duct tissues (n=26) was analyzed by qRT-PCR (P=0.006) and WB (P=0.013). Representative images are shown in the upper panel. β-actin (or ACTB) was used as the internal control, experiments were repeated three times, and data are shown as mean ± SD, *P<0.05. D. The expression of TACC3 in CCA tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues (n=79) analyzed by IHC. (a) negative TACC3 staining in adjacent non-tumor bile duct tissues (200X); (b) negative TACC3 staining in CCA tissues (400X); (c) weak TACC3 staining in the cytoplasm (400X); (d) moderate TACC3 staining in the cytoplasm (400X); (e, f) strong TACC3 staining in the cytoplasm (200X,400X). Scale bar, 100 μm. E. Kaplan-Meier analysis showing that patients with low TACC3 expression (n=34) had longer OS than patients with high TACC3 expression (n=45; median OS: 40 months vs 17 months, P<0.001). Patients in stage I-II with low TACC3 expression (n=27) had longer OS than patients with high TACC3 expression (n=18; median OS: 42 months vs 17 months, P=0.0077). However, there was no correlation observed in patients with stage III-IV CCA (median OS: 40 months vs 25 months, P=0.2454, log-rank test).
          
          
        
        Next, we investigated the expression of TACC3 protein in CCA cell lines by WB. TACC3 was also down-regulated after cells were treated with HDACIs (P<0.05; Figure 3B), but TSA more effectively down-regulated TACC3 expression than SAHA in CCA cells. These findings were investigated further with qRT-PCR and WB in 26 pairs of CCA tissues and non-tumor tissues. We found that TACC3 expression was higher in CCA tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels (P<0.05; Figure 3C). IHC studies on 79 paraffin-embedded CCA specimens indicated that TACC3 was localized to the cytoplasm of CCA cells (Figure 3D). The expression of TACC3 in CCA tissues was higher than in the paired adjacent non-tumor tissues (P=0.008; Table 1). These findings strongly suggested that TACC3 was down-regulated after treatment with HDACIs and up-regulated in CCA tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, and that TACC3 may be a potential anti-tumor molecular drug target of HDACIs in CCA.
        To investigate whether TACC3 expression is correlated with CCA progression, we analyzed its association with the clinicopathological characteristics of CCA specimens. As shown in Table 1, there was a strong correlation between high TACC3 expression and lymph node status (P=0.003), TNM stage (P<0.001), and differentiation (P<0.001), but not with age (P=0.259) or gender (P=0.238). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that OS was shorter for patients with high TACC3 expression than for those with low TACC3 expression (P<0.001; Figure 3E). Furthermore, TACC3 expression was correlated with OS in patients with stage I-II disease (n=45; P=0.0077; Figure 3E), but not in patients with stage III-IV disease (n=34; P=0.2454; Figure 3E). Additionally, multivariate analysis showed that TACC3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with CCA (95%CI: 1.503–3.1670; P=0.0063; Table 2).
      
      
        Knockdown of TACC3 suppresses the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of CCA cells
        To investigate the potential roles of TACC3 in CCA tumorigenesis, we stably knocked down TACC3 in TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells with lentiviral transfection of two TACC3 shRNA duplexes. For the rescue experiment, lentiviruses carrying TACC3 cDNA were re-transfected into the cells with TACC3 shRNA or transfected into TSA-treated cells. qRT-PCR, WB, and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses confirmed that TACC3 expression was down-regulated in cells treated with TSA or TACC3 shRNA (P<0.05; Figure 4A&4B), while the expression of TACC3 was rescued in cells transfected with TACC3 cDNA (P<0.05; Figure 4A&4B). Compared with the blank and negative control (NC) groups, TSA treatment and TACC3 shRNA treatment resulted in markedly lower cell viability (P<0.05; Figure 4C). TSA treatment reduced the number of colonies formed compared with the NC group (TFK-1: 44±16.5 vs 276±25.1 cells per well, P<0.001; HuCCT-1: 52.7±21.9 vs 243.3±32.2 cells per well, P<0.001), and when TSA-treated cells were transfected with TACC3 cDNA, the number of colonies formed was increased compared with TSA treatment (TFK-1: 130.7±43.6 vs 44±16.5 cells per well, P<0.05; HuCCT-1: 120.5±27.2 vs 52.7±21.9 cells per well, P<0.05). Similarly, there was a decrease in the number of colonies formed in cells with TACC3 shRNA knockdown compared with the NC group (TFK-1: 29.3±10.1 & 30±17.6 vs 276±25.1 cells per well, P<0.001; HuCCT-1: 23.3±15.3 & 49.7±17.9 vs 243.3±32.2 cells per well, P<0.001), while TACC3 shRNA cells given TACC3 cDNA had increased colony formation (TFK-1: 29.3±10.1 & 30±17.6 vs 150±36.1 cells per well, P<0.05 ; HuCCT-1: 24.3±15.3 & 49.7±17.9 vs 153.3±41.6 cells per well, P<0.05, Figure 4D). These results indicated a growth-promoting role of TACC3 in CCA cells.
        
          Figure 4
          
            Knockdown of TACC3 suppresses proliferation and colony formation of CCA cells
            TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells were treated with TSA or small interfering RNAs as indicated, and empty vector was used as the negative control (NC). A. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to detect the expression of TACC3. For WB analysis, representative imagines are shown (middle panels). Statistical analysis of the relative optical density of each band is shown (lower panels). β-actin was used as an internal control, experiments were repeated three times, and data are shown as mean ± SD, *P<0.05. B. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of TACC3 (green). DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nuclei. The fluorescence intensity of TACC3 was stronger in NC groups, and was weaker in cells treated with TSA or transfected with shRNA. In the TACC3 shRNA rescue experiment, fluorescence intensity was recovered. One representative experiment out of the three performed is shown (400X). C. Survival rate of TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. Experiments were repeated three times and data are shown as mean ± SD. D. Colony formation assays were performed to evaluate the proliferative capability of TFK-1 (upper panel) and HuCCT-1(lower panel) cells. A representative image is shown, and a statistical comparison of the indicated groups was performed across three independent experiments, *P<0.05 and **P<0.001.
          
          
        
        To explore the effects of TACC3 on the cell cycle, FACS was used to assess cell cycle distributions following TACC3 silencing or overexpression. Knockdown of TACC3 promoted G2/M arrest (P<0.05, Figure 5A), whereas G1/S transition was suppressed in TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells. In addition, when TACC3 knockdown cells were given TACC3 cDNA, the G2/M phase distribution was decreased (P<0.05, Figure 5A). Moreover, the expression of G2/M phase checkpoint proteins, CDK1 and cyclin B1 were down-regulated with TACC3 knockdown (P<0.05, Figure 5B), and up-regulated when TACC3 knockdown cells were given TACC3 cDNA (P<0.05, Figure 5B). Furthermore, wound healing occurred more slowly in cells treated with TSA or transfected with TACC3 shRNA compared with the NC cells (P<0.001; Figure 5C). When cells were transfected with TACC3 cDNA, cell migration was enhanced compared with TSA treatment or TACC3 knockdown (TFK-1: P<0.05; HuCCT-1: P<0.001; Figure 5C). Likewise, treatment with TSA or knockdown of TACC3 expression reduced the invasiveness of CCA cells compared with the NC group (P<0.001; Figure 5D), while TACC3 up-regulation enhanced cell invasion capability (P<0.05; Figure 5D). Finally, we used WB to assay the expression of EMT-associated proteins in TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells after TSA treatment or transfection with TACC3 shRNA. Knockdown of TACC3 increased E-cadherin expression and decreased vimentin expression (P<0.05; Figure 5E). Expression of HDAC2 and HDAC3, which correlated with lymphatic metastasis and prognosis in CCA patients, were also decreased (P<0.05; Figure 5E). With TACC3 rescue, the expression of vimentin, HDAC2, and HDAC3 were elevated, while E-cadherin expression was decreased (P<0.05; Figure 5E). These results indicated that knockdown of TACC3 suppresses the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of CCA cells and suggested that TACC3 is an anti-cancer molecular drug target of HDACIs.

        Targeted silencing of TACC3 suppresses CCA tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo
        To further investigate the potential therapeutic role of TACC3 in CCA, a subcutaneous tumor model was established in nude mice. Xenograft tumors grown from blank and NC cells had larger mean volumes and weights and were frequently more aggressive than tumors grown from cells transfected with TACC3 shRNA (HuCCT-1, P<0.001; TFK-1, P<0.001; Figure 6A). Next, a pulmonary metastasis tumor model was generated by injection of tumor cells into the tail vein of nude mice. Fewer metastatic nodes were detected in the pulmonary tissues of the treatment groups (TFK-1: TACC3 shRNA-1, P<0.05; TACC3 shRNA-2, P<0.001; Figure 6B). qRT-PCR, WB and IHC were performed to verify knockdown of TACC3. Expression of TACC3 was decreased in subcutaneous tumors formed by cells that were transfected with TACC3 shRNA (P<0.05; Figure 6C&6D). These results indicated that targeted TACC3 knockdown suppresses tumor growth and metastasis of CCA cells, in vivo.

      DISCUSSION
      CCA is the second most common hepatobiliary malignancy [1] and is one of the most life-threatening diseases due to its aggressiveness and metastatic tendencies [36]. In spite of substantial progress, we still lack a valid biomarker that is involved in tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in patients with CCA. Therefore, it is urgent to find a new molecular target for therapy and to predict the prognosis of patients with CCA. Many studies have reported the differential expression of specific HDAC isoforms in a variety of hematological or solid malignancies and cell lines, such as lymphoma [14], breast [15], gastric [16], colorectal [17], and lung cancers [18], hepatocellular carcinoma [19], and cholangiocarcinoma [20]. Class I and II HDACs are overexpressed in a variety of CCA cell lines; however, few studies have investigated HDAC expression status and its prognostic value in CCA patients [20]. In this study, we investigated the expression of HDACs 1-10 and their biological significance in CCA. We found that HDACs 2, 3 and 8 were up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels in CCA tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. In addition, the expression of HDACs 2 and 3 proteins, but not HDAC8, was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and differentiation. Moreover, patients with high expression of HDAC2 or HDAC3 (or both) had shorter OS. These results indicated that HDAC2 and 3 may serve as useful prognostic biomarkers and that the modulation of the histone acetylation may be a novel therapeutic strategy for CCA. HDACIs have the potential to disrupt multiple signaling pathways to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis [37, 38]. Our data showed that TSA and SAHA inhibited the proliferation of CCA cells and induced apoptosis as well as G2/M cell cycle arrest. Mottamal et al. reported that Epoxide 1-Alaninechlamydocin isolated from Tolypocladium sp. also elicited potent anti-proliferative effects, induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in human cancer cells [39]. Our results are consistent with those of an earlier report that claimed that TSA induced a delay in G2/M transition of HeLa cells via the downregulation of Cyclin B1, PIK1 and Survivin, and via the upregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 [40].
      Furthermore, to identify the target transcripts of HDACIs that may be potential regulators of the suppression of CCA tumorigenesis, we determined mRNA expression profiles by microarray analysis. The microarray results revealed that the expression of TACC3 was down-regulated in CCA cell lines upon treatment with TSA, a finding confirmed by qRT-PCT and WB. Until recently, it has been unclear whether TACC3 acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene. Accumulating evidence indicates that alterations in TACC3 expression depend on the organ and type of cancer [30–35]. In this study, we found that TACC3 was overexpressed in CCA tissues and was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and differentiation. In addition, patients whose tumors had high TACC3 expression exhibited a shortened survival time, and this correlation was more obvious in patients with stage I-II cancers compared with patients with stage III-IV cancers. Our study demonstrated that TACC3 may be a potential anti-cancer molecular drug target of HDACIs and a potential prognostic indicator for CCA.
      Recently, various reports have suggested that TACC3 may be a potential therapeutic target and that the targeted knockdown of TACC3 can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. TACC3 overexpression is associated with defective checkpoint control and impaired DNA repair systems, resulting in genomic instability [41]. Additionally, TACC3 participates in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and transcription [27]. HDACIs decrease ionic interactions between DNA and histones, which results in chromatin relaxation and the subsequent acceleration of DNA transcription. However, the exact relationship of HDACIs and TACC3 has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that HDACIs downregulate TACC3 expression and that targeted TACC3 knockdown suppresses CCA cell proliferation and colony formation, and induces G2/M phase arrest in vitro. These findings are in agreement with previous studies that down-regulated TACC3 inhibits cell growth in esophageal cancer [42]. In addition, TACC3-depleted cells were highly sensitive to paclitaxel-induced cell death, which occurred even when the levels of active Akt and p21 were high [43]. Moreover, Yim et al. also reported that TACC3 knockdown combined with paclitaxel treatment led to a synergistic acceleration of G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in HeLa cells [44]. Taken together, these findings indicate that TACC3 may be a potential anti-cancer molecular target either in combination with other drugs or alone.
      EMT is a pivotal process in the early phase of the metastasis cascade and can be initiated by various signaling pathways [45]. Up-regulated expression of TACC3 promotes EGF-mediated EMT via the initiation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling transduction pathways [27, 29]. To investigate whether alterations in TACC3 gene expression impact the ability of CCA cells to invade and migrate, wound-healing and Transwell assays were performed. We found that knockdown of TACC3 reduced the invasive and migratory ability of CCA cells, while increased TACC3 expression increased invasion and migration. In addition, elevated expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and reduced expression of the mesenchymal marker, vimentin, after TACC3 knockdown verified the role of TACC3 in EMT. These findings indicated that TACC3 might act as an important regulator of CCA metastasis.
      Based on our interesting in vitro findings, we next established subcutaneous and pulmonary metastasis tumor models to further investigate the potential therapeutic role of TACC3 in CCA, in vivo. We found that targeted silencing of TACC3 markedly inhibited xenograft tumor growth and the formation of pulmonary metastatic nodes, suggesting that down-regulation of TACC3 suppresses EMT-induced invasion and metastasis. Another study demonstrated that TACC3 suppression causes tumor regression and leads to embryonic lethality in mice due to massive apoptosis in tumor, but not normal, tissues [46]. Therefore, the targeted silencing of TACC3 may be a valid approach for anti-tumor therapy for CCA; however, its mechanism still needs further experimental exploration.
      In summary, we observed that HDACs 2, 3, and 8 were over-expressed in CCA tissues and that HDACs 2 and 3 may serve as useful prognostic biomarkers for CCA. The HDACIs, TSA and SAHA, inhibited the proliferation of CCA cells and induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Microarray analysis demonstrated that TSA led to the down-regulation of TACC3, and that patients with CCA with a high TACC3 expression were predicted to have a poor prognosis. Therefore, targeted TACC3 silencing may be a valid approach for anti-tumor therapy for patients with CCA.
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Patients and tissue specimens
        Two independent series including 105 patients with CCA were enrolled in this study. Group 1: 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded paired tissues, which included CCA samples and adjacent non-tumor tissues (2 cm away from the tumor boundaries) were obtained from 79 CCA patients who underwent resection between January 2008 and July 2010 at the Department of Biliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. The clinicopathological information of the 79 patients with CCA is listed in Supplementary Table S1. Group 2: twenty-six fresh CCA samples and adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected from the same hospital between January 2014 and December 2014. None of the patients had received any chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to surgery. All diagnoses were confirmed by 2 pathologists at Tongji Hospital. Tumor staging was based on the TNM classification standard of the 7th edition of the UICC/AJCC staging manual. All patients signed an informed consent before surgery, and the ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Tongji Hospital Research Ethics Committee (Supplementary Figure S1).
      
      
        Cell lines
        Two human CCA cell lines, TFK-1 and HuCCT-1, were kindly provided by Professor Peter Schemmer (Department of General and Transplant Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany). The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, CA, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Beijing, China) and were maintained at 37°C in an incubator with 5% CO2.
      
      
        Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis
        Total RNA was isolated from tissue specimens or from cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using 2 μg of the total RNA according to the instructions of the reverse transcriptase kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China) in a LifePro Thermal Cycler (Hangzhou Bioer Technology Co. Ltd., Hangzhou, China). Then, cDNA samples (2 μl) were subjected to qRT-PCR using a SYBR® Premix EX Taq kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China) for 40 cycles in a CFX ConnectTM Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). ACTB was used as an internal control. Primers were designed and synthesized by Shanghai Sango Biotech Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China (listed in Supplementary Table S2). The cycle threshold (Ct) of different genes was first normalized to ACTB for the same sample, and fold changes were calculated through relative quantification (2−ΔΔCt).
      
      
        Western blotting (WB) analysis
        WB analysis was performed as previous described [47, 48]. As an internal control, blots were incubated with antibodies to glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or β-actin. The primary antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table S3. To quantify the relative levels of protein expression, the intensity of the specific bands was estimated using the Image J2X analysis software package (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
      
      
        Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
        The streptavidin biotin compound (SABC) method was used to detect the expression of HDAC2, 3, 8 and TACC3 proteins, as previously described [47]. The sections were incubated with a polyclonal or a monoclonal antibody overnight at 4°C in a moist chamber at the indicated dilutions (listed in Supplementary Table S3). The next day, the sections were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 30 min at 37°C. Finally, the sections were incubated with streptavidin-biotin complex (Boster Biotech, Wuhan, China) at a dilution of 1:100 for 5 min and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin, which stains the nucleus. The slides were dehydrated, mounted, and observed by microscopy. IHC scores were assessed by 3 pathologists who were blinded to the patient conditions, as previously described [47].
      
      
        Microarray analysis
        TFK-1 cells that were treated with 1% DMSO and TSA (0.3 μmol/L) for 48 hours were selected for microarray analysis; cells selection occurred in triplicate. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, CA, USA), the concentration of RNA in the samples was detected by a NanoDrop ND-2000 (Thermo Scientific) and RNA integrity was assessed by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized and labeled (Cyanine-3-CTP) before it was purified and hybridized to the microarray (Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression Array, 8*60K, Design ID: 039494). After washing, the arrays were scanned by an Agilent Scanner G2505C (Agilent Technologies). Original data were extracted using Feature Extraction software (version 10.7.1.1, Agilent Technologies). Further data analysis was conducted using Agilent Genespring software (version 12.5). To identify significant differential expression of mRNAs, we performed a Volcano Plot filtering (Fold Change >=2.0 and P-value <=0.05) between the DMSO group and the TSA-treated group. After that, the significantly differentially expressed genes were further analyzed by GO and KEGG software to judge their biological function and the pathways through which they function. Finally, hierarchical clustering was performed based on the significant differential expression of mRNAs, and a thermograph was used to demonstrate the expression patterns of the differentially expressed genes between both groups.
      
      
        Cell viability assay in vitro
        A CCK-8 kit (Dojindo Laboratories Co. Ltd, Kumamoto, Japan) was used as a colorimetric assay to assess cell viability. Briefly, cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates with 100 μl per well of RPMI-1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and the indicated reagents. Each sample had six replicates. At the indicated time points, the medium was replaced by 100 μl fresh culture medium, and 10 μl CCK-8 solution was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1-4 hours at 37°C before the absorbance was recorded at 450 nm using a Quant ELISA Reader (BioTek Instruments, USA). The percentage of viable cells was calculated according to the following method in a previously published report [48]: Survival Rate % =(ODtreated − ODblank)/(ODcontrol − ODblank) × 100%. The IC50 was calculated using probit regression analysis. The tests were repeated at least 3 times.
      
      
        Flow cytometry
        Cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Then, the medium was replaced by 2 ml fresh experimental medium containing TSA or SAHA at different concentrations according to the 48-hour IC50 values. After 48 hours, cells were harvested, and the rate of apoptosis was determined by an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit (KeyGen Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software. For cell cycle analysis, after 48 hours the cells were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 20°C, stained with propidium iodide, and then analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and ModFit 3.0 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA).
      
      
        Lentiviral vector construction and establishment stable cell clones
        Three recombinant lentiviruses containing TACC3 (GenBank access number: NM_006342.2) expressing TACC3-shRNA-1 (GCATGCACGGTGCAAATGA), TACC3-shRNA-2 (CCACAGATCTGAACTCCAT) and TACC3-specific cDNA were purchased from Genechem Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The GV248 vector (hU6-MCS-Ubiquitin-EGFP-IRES-puromycin) used for the stable expression of shRNA against TACC3 and a fluorescent marker (GFP-RFP fusion protein) contained a puromycin resistance gene. The negative control (NC) sequence was indicated as “NC” and had no homology to any human genomic sequences. In addition, the cDNA of the human TACC3 gene, a fragment encoding the TACC3-sequence plus 1439 bp at both 5’- and 3’- flanking regions was amplified with the primers 5’- GAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGGTCGCCACCATGAGTCTGCAGGTCTTAAACGAC-3’ (forward) and 5’- TCCTTGTAGTCCATACCGATCTTCTCCATCTTGGAGATGAG-3’(reverse) by PCR from human genomic DNA and then cloned into the AgeI/NheI sites of GV358. Lentiviral transfection was conducted according to the GenePharma Recombinant Lentivirus Operation Manual (http://www.genepharma.com). TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates for 24 hours, and after the addition of polybrene (8 μg/ml), the cells were infected with 2 μl of concentrated lentivirus for 72 hours. Cells were selected for 2 weeks with the addition of puromycin (5 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St, Louis, USA) to generate stable monoclonal cell lines. For the rescue experiment, stable cells with TACC3 shRNA or cells treated with TSA (0.3 μmol/L) for 48 hours were grown in 6-well plates, and re-infected with 2 μl of concentrated lentivirus for 72 hours. Cells were selected for 2 weeks by the addition of puromycin to generate stable monoclonal cell lines. The expression of TACC3 was confirmed by qRT-PCR, WB, and immunofluorescence.
      
      
        Immunofluorescence (IF) assay
        Cells grown on cover slips in 6-well plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature and then permeabilized by treatment with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Amresco, OH, USA) for 10 minutes. After blocking with 1% BSA (Amresco, OH, USA) in 1X PBS (2 ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C, the cells were incubated at 4°C overnight with the primary antibody (TACC3, 1:50). Then, the cells were rinsed and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L; 1:20, ProteinTech Group) as the secondary antibody. After the cells were washed in PBS, the nuclei were stained by DAPI (5 μg/ml, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) for 2 minutes at room temperature. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS, Japan).
      
      
        Colony formation assay
        Cells (500 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured for 2 weeks. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, cells were stained with 1% crystal violet. Colonies with diameters greater than 100 μm were counted, and experiments were run independently in triplicate.
      
      
        Wound healing assay
        Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured until they reached sufficient confluence. The cell monolayers were scratched manually with a 200 μl pipette tip. The plates were washed with PBS twice to remove floating cells. Cells were then incubated in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 1% FBS for 48 hours after the scratches were generated. Images of 6 random fields were captured by phase contrast microscopy (Nikon Corporation) for quantitative analysis. The area into which the cells migrated was measured using the Image Pro Plus v6.0 software package (Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA).
      
      
        Transwell assay
        Transwell chambers (Corning NY, USA) were pretreated with a mixture of RPMI-1640 and BD Matrigel (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA) (90 μl; 8:1), which served as the basement membrane. After the membrane was hydrated in 0.1% BSA, cells (1 × 105 cells/chamber) were seeded into the top chamber with 200 μl RPMI-1640 supplemented with 0.2% FBS. After 48 hours, cells were fixed and stained. Cell counts were performed using the Image-Pro Plus v6.0 software package (Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA). Each group of cells was counted in triplicate.
      
      
        In vivo tumorigenicity and metastasis assays
        For the tumorigenicity assay, TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells (2 × 106 cells, suspended in 100 μl RPMI-1640 without FBS) were subcutaneously injected into the upper right flank of nude mice (4-6 week-old, BALB/c/nu, female). Tumor sizes were measured by a vernier caliper every three days. Mice were sacrificed three weeks after the injection of the cells. For the metastasis assay, TFK-1 cells were injected into the tail vein of nude mice. After 6 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and the metastatic nodes in the lungs were examined by necropsy and counted. All of the in vivo experiments were performed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions with the approval of the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Tongji Medical College. Details are provided in the Supplementary Figure S2.
      
      
        Statistical analyses
        Quantitatative data are presented as the means ± the standard deviation (SD). Significance was assessed using 2-tailed Student's t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Pearson's correlation test, when applicable. Categorical data were analyzed by the χ2 test. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used to assess survival among the subgroups. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the independent survival factors based on the variables selected in the univariate and multivariate analyses.

        Macrophages occur as resident cells of fetal origin or as infiltrating blood monocyte-derived cells. Despite the critical role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumor progression, the contribution of these developmentally and functionally distinct macrophage subsets and their alteration by the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. We have addressed this question by comparing TAMs from human ovarian carcinoma ascites, resident peritoneal macrophages (pMPHs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Our study revealed striking a similarity between TAMs and pMPHs, which was considerably greater that the resemblance of TAMs and MDMs, including their transcriptomes, their inflammation-related activation state, the presence of receptors mediating immune functions and the expression of tumor-promoting mediators. Consistent with these results, TAMs phagocytized bacteria, presented peptide antigens and activated cytotoxic T cells within their pathophysiological environment. These observations support the notion that tumor-promoting properties of TAMs may reflect, at least to some extent, normal features of resident macrophages rather than functions induced by the tumor microenvironment. In spite of these surprising similarities between TAMs and pMPHs, bioinformatic analyses identified a TAM-selective signature of 30 genes that are upregulated relative to both pMPHs and MDMs. The majority of these genes is linked to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, supporting a role for TAMs in cancer cell invasion and ovarian cancer progression.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common ovarian malignancy with a dire prognosis with an overall 5-year survival rate of <40% [1]. The features that contribute to the fatal nature of ovarian HGSC and distinguish this cancer from other human malignancies include the peritoneal environment, which is frequently formed by the effusion building up in the peritoneal cavity. This malignancy associated ascites is rich in tumor-promoting soluble factors [2] and immune cells, in particular tumor-associated T cells (TATs) [3] and tumor-associated macrophages [4, 5] (TAMs).
      TAMs play a crucial role in promoting tumor cell proliferation, dissemination, chemoresistance and immune evasion, as suggested by the correlation of disease progression with macrophage density in different types of human cancer and mouse models, including ovarian HGSC [6–8]. Although TAMs can be derived from recruited blood monocytes [9–11], more recent evidence clearly points to a substantial contribution by tissue-resident macrophages [12–18].
      A hallmark of macrophages is their plasticity in response to their microenvironment [19], with “M1” and “M2” macrophages as operationally defined extremes [20]. Classical M1 activation confers immune stimulatory, pro-inflammatory properties, while alternatively activated M2 macrophages comprise a wide spectrum of subtypes with functions in tissue repair, angiogenesis and immune regulation. TAMs have been proposed to resemble “M2” macrophages, in agreement with their role in tumor promotion and immune suppression. Consistent with this conclusion, expression of the classical M2 marker CD163 on TAMs showed a strong correlation with early relapse of serous ovarian carcinoma after first-line therapy [4]. Furthermore, data derived from mouse models showed that pro-inflammatory signaling pathways are defective in TAMs [7, 20–23]. However, macrophages can also adopt properties of both M1 and M2 cells [19], and several studies suggest that TAMs represent such a mixed-polarization phenotype [4, 11, 20, 24].
      Macrophages in the adult mouse can have two developmentally different origins. While infiltrating macrophages are derived from blood monocytes produced by the bone marrow, tissue macrophages, including alveolar, peritoneal, splenic, hepatic (Kupfer cells) and dermal (Langerhans cells) macrophages, are of fetal (yolk sac) origin [17, 25–30]. The transcription factor MYB is essential for the development of murine bone-marrow macrophages [25], whereas GATA6 is indispensable for the fetal lineage and distinguishes resident from infiltrating macrophage [26, 31]. Whether ovarian cancer ascites-associated macrophages are derived from infiltrating monocytes, resident peritoneal macrophages or both is unclear.
      Our current view of the tumor-mediated activation state of macrophages is largely based on studies comparing TAMs to monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) [9, 32]. Systematic analyses comparing TAMs to normal, uncultured macrophages are currently not available. The present study reveals for the first time a surprising similarity between TAMs and resident peritoneal macrophages (pMPHs) with respect to both their differentiation and polarization state, but also delineates a TAM-selective signature associated that is associated with extracellular matrix remodeling.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Similar expression of differentiation and activation markers by TAMs and pMPHs
        We first compared pMPHs from patients undergoing hysterectomy for non-malignant diseases and TAMs from ovarian cancer ascites (Supplementary Table S1) for expression of inflammation and activation markers by flow cytometry. The data in Figure 1A and 1B show that surface expression of the Fcγ receptors CD16 (FCGR3), CD32 (FCGR2) and CD64 (FCGR1) was similar for both cell types, with respect to both the fraction of positive cells (Figure 1A) and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI; Figure 1B). HLA-DR was expressed on >95% of all cells analyzed, but the measured MFI was clearly higher on MPHs (Figure 1B). The “M2” markers CD163, CD206 and intracellular IL-10 were similarly expressed by both TAMs and pMPHs, except for a tendency towards a higher fraction of CD163+ and CD206+ in MPH samples (Figure 1B). Our data also indicate that neither CD163 nor CD206 distinguishes TAMs from pMPHs, regardless of the underlying non-malignant condition of the patients (Figure 1C). Consistent with our observation, human pMPHs have previously been shown to express high levels of CD163 and display characteristics of anti-inflammatory macrophages [33]. Thus, while there are detectable differences between TAMs and pMPHs, both cell types do not differ in terms of a directional inflammation-related polarization switch.

        To identify differences between TAMs and pMPHs by a systematic approach we compared the transcriptome of 17 TAM, 4 pMPH and 3 of non-polarized (M0) MDM samples by RNA sequencing (all RNA-Seq data in Supplementary Dataset S1; TAM and pMPH samples were uncultured primary cells). Pearson correlation of median gene expression values showed a high similarity of all TAM and pMPH transcriptomes (r = 0.93), while MDM were considerably more divergent (r = 0.79; Supplementary Figure S1). Pearson correlation analysis for individual samples yielded a similar result (median r = 0.84 for TAMs versus pMPHs; r = 0.74 for TAMs versus MDMs; Figure 2A, 2B). These results were confirmed by PCA which split our samples in two groups: TAM/pMPH and MDM (Figure 2C). As expected the correlation between TAMs and TATs or tumor cells was very low (r = 0.34; Figure 2B).

        Consistent with the global resemblance of TAMs and pMPHs, at least 3 markers selectively expressed in resident macrophages in the mouse [26–29, 31, 34–36], i.e., ADGRE1 (F4/80), GATA6 and TIMD4, were expressed at similar levels in both TAMs and pMPHs, but much lower, if at all, in MDMs (Figure 3A). The opposite scenario was observed for CD52, reported to be preferentially expressed in monocyte-derived cells [37]. In agreement with these data, TIMD4 surface expression was stronger on TAMs compared to MDMs (Figure 1D), whereas CD52 was higher on MDMs (Figure 1E).

        The RNA-Seq data also revealed similar expression levels in TAMs and MPHs for all markers of macrophage functions tested, including phagocytosis-associated receptor genes (CD36, MSR1, SCAR family genes, TIMD4, CD163), FCGR genes, complement receptor genes (CD93/C1Q-R1, C3AR, CR1, C5AR1) and all polarization marker genes tested, including CD163 and IL10 (Figure 3A). These observations are in perfect agreement with the flow cytometry analysis described above (Figure 1A–1C). Similar observations were made for genes encoding pro-tumorigenic cytokines or growth factor (Figure 3B), previously found to be mainly expressed by TAMs within the ovarian cancer microenvironment [38]. These results indicate that ovarian carcinoma ascites-associated TAMs closely resemble pMPHs not only with respect to their activation state but also with regard to some of their pro-tumorigenic functions.
      
      
        Immune functions of TAMs
        The similarity with pMPHs described above suggested that macrophage-mediated immune functions might be preserved in ovarian carcinoma TAMs, at least to some extent. While TAMs can be maintained ex vivo for functional assays under conditions resembling their pathophysiological microenvironment (ascites), it is not possible to culture pMPHs under physiological conditions (e.g, peritoneal fluid). We therefore focused our analyses on short-term cultures of TAMs in ascites, and used MDMs as positive controls.
        An essential function of tissue resident macrophages is the phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic cells [27, 33, 39–41]. Consistent with the expression pattern of phagocytosis-associated receptors (Figure 3A) the TAMs were able to efficiently phagocytize labelled E. coli particles (Figure 4A, 4B).
        
          Figure 4

        Another function reported for human pMPHs is the presentation of peptide antigens [42–46]. In view of the high expression of HLA genes in TAMs (Figure 1) we therefore investigated the capacity of TAMs to trigger antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell activation. For this purpose, we exposed TAMs to a mixture of antigens (CEFT) derived from pathogens most individuals have previously been sensitized to and have developed antigen-specific memory T cells. Restimulation with these recall antigens results in the activation of this subset of antigen-specific T cells (1% of all T cells). Using intracellular IFNγ production as an activation marker, we found a clear stimulation of CD8+ T cells by TAMs within a range similar to the positive control (Figure 4C; non-stimulated cells served as negative controls for background substraction). Collectively, these data show that known immune functions of pMPHs are retained by TAMs in their pathophysiological environment.
        Previous studies in mouse models have shown that pro-inflammatory signaling pathways are non-functional in TAMs in different tumor types [7, 20–23], and that ovarian cancer TAMs are refractory to pro-inflammatory stimuli [47]. In agreement with these observations we found that both expression of the pro-inflammatory mediator gene IL12B and secretion of its product p40 are not inducible by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (INFγ) in TAMs, whereas a strong induction was observed with the positive control (Figure 4D, 4E).
      
      
        Genome-wide expression profiles of TAMs and pMPHs and delineation of a TAM-specific signature
        We next sought to gain further insight into the specific phenotype of ovarian cancer TAMs by in-depth analysis of the transcriptomic data. Toward this end, we started out by analyzing the RNA-Seq data sets with edgeR, a Bioconductor package specifically developed for reliable gene-specific dispersion estimation in small samples by ranking genes that behave consistently across replicates more highly than genes that do not [48, 49]. The edgeR tool identified a group of 21 genes expressed at significantly different levels in TAMs versus pMPHs (Supplementary Table S1). We then searched for genes showing highly correlated expression pattern across all TAM samples (r >0.9) and a higher median expression in TAMs versus pMPH or vice versa (FC >3-fold). This resulted in the definition of an extended datasets of 30 genes upregulated in TAMs (Supplementary Dataset S2; Supplementary Figure S2; Figure 5A). PCA of TAM, pMPH and MDM samples for the upregulated gene set yielded clearly separable clusters for TAMs versus pMPHs or MDMs (Figure 5A), showing that the chosen strategy was successful.

        We performed similar analyses with TAMs and MDMs (Supplementary Table S2) leading to an extended datasets of 497 upregulated genes (Figure 5B). The majority of genes upregulated in TAMs versus pMPHs (20/30) were also upregulated relative to MDMs (Figure 5B), thus providing a further validation of the upregulated gene set. Since only few genes were downregulated in TAMs versus pMPHs (n = 4; Supplementary Dataset S3; Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Figure S4), we focused all further analyses on the upregulated gene set.
      
      
        A TAM-specific ECM gene cluster
        Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis showed a very strong association of the upregulated genes with extracellular matrix (ECM) and collagen fibril organization (Figure 5C; Supplementary Table S3). IPA Upstream Regulator Analysis identified these genes as targets mainly of TGFB and pro-inflammatory (LPS, TNF, INFG) signaling pathways (Figure 5D). This is intriguing in light of previous studies reporting the presence of TNFα and TGFβ1 in the ascites of the vast majority of ovarian cancer patients and their association with disease progression [2, 4, 50–53]. Hierarchial clustering using correlation as distance metric identified a group of 19 co-regulated genes, which make up 63% of all upregulated genes identified (Figures 5E and Supplementary Figure S2). Intriguingly, this cluster harbors virtually all regulated genes associated with ECM remodeling. We subsequently refer to these genes as the “ECM cluster”.
        The expression patterns of the ECM signature genes in TAMs and pMPHs shown in Figure 6A (red versus blue bars) clearly document their selective upregulation in TAMs. Similar results were obtained when expression in TAMs was compared to MDMs (red versus grey bars in Figure 6A) with only few exceptions, providing further evidence tor the robustness of the ECM signature and its association with tumor-triggered events. Comparison with tumor cells and TATs showed that most of these genes are mainly expressed by TAMs and tumor cells (Figure 6B). We also analyzed several genes of the ECM signature by RT-qPCR and could fully verify the RNA-Seq data in all for cases (Figure 6C). Finally, we also found readily detectable levels of PCOLCE2 protein by ELSIA in ovarian cancer ascites (Figure 6D), supporting a potential functional relevance of the upregulated ECM signature genes.
        
          Figure 6
          
            Expression of ECM signature genes

        Contamination of TAM samples with tumor cells was very low in most samples, in several cases even undetectable (Supplementary Table S4). Furthermore, none of the ECM cluster genes were expressed at substantially higher levels by tumor cells relative to TAMs (Figure 6B), thus ruling out the possibility that the expression observed in TAM samples results from residual tumor cells. Another cell type present in ascites, albeit at low numbers, are carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [54]. Importantly, all CAF marker genes analyzed were either expressed at similar levels in both TAMs and pMPHs (Supplementary Figure S5) and/or did not show any appreciable correlation with expression of ECM cluster genes, as exemplified for COL3A1 in Supplementary Figure S6. Similar results were obtained for markers of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and mesothelial cells (Supplementary Figure S5 and Supplementary Figure S7), known to be present ovarian cancer ascites in ascites [54]. We therefore conclude that potential contaminations of TAM samples do are unlikely to make a significant contribution to the observed TAM-specific signature.
        Importantly, proteins encoded by upregulated genes are also found in the ascites fluid from ovarian cancer patients, supporting potentially relevant functions. This is exemplified in Figure 5C for PCOLCE 2 (upregulated in TAMs ~20-fold). Furthermore, previous proteomic profiling of ovarian cancer ascites identified several proteins relevant in this context, including multiple collagens and lumican [55]. In addition, collagen type I, III and IV fragments have been found at elevated levels in serum samples from ovarian cancer patients [56].
        Taken together, these observations suggest that the upregulation of ECM remodeling genes is a hallmark of ovarian cancer TAMs. The coordinate regulation of the genes within this cluster is presumably caused by a tumor-triggered signaling pathway rather than merely a consequence of a genomic co-localization. The 5 COL genes of the ECM cluster, for instance, are localized on 4 different human chromosomes (2, 7, 9 and 17), LUM on chromosome 12 and PCOLCE2 on chromosome 3 (Ensembl).
      
    
    
      DISCUSSION
      
        Activation state and immune functions of TAMs
        Our flow cytometry and transcriptome data clearly show that markers are expressed in ovarian cancer TAMs in a way inconsistent with a directional inflammation-related polarization. On the other hand, these analyses revealed a surprisingly high similarity of TAMs and pMPHs, including their activation state and the expression of molecules with essential roles in immune functions. Thus, tissue resident macrophages, like TAMs, are characterized by a high expression of the alternative activation markers CD163 and CD206 [33]. and both TAMs and pMPHs express genes with essential functions in phagocytosis or antigen presentation at similarly high levels (Figures 1A–1C, Figure 3A).
        Consistent with the high expression of scavenger receptors and other molecules involved in phagocytosis (Figure 3A), TAMs efficiently phagocytosed bacteria within their pathophysiological environment, i.e., ovarian cancer ascites (Figure 4A, 4B). TAMs share this function with pMPHs, known as major players in the clearance of pathogens and damaged cells [33]. Furthermore, in agreement with the strong expression of multiple HLA genes (Figure 3A), TAMs were able to trigger an antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell response (Figure 4C), which is also known as a function of pMPHs [42–45].
        Previous work has shown that peritoneal macrophages in the mouse consist of two functionally and developmentally distinct subsets, with cells of fetal origin representing the vast majority [30]. In the mouse, these resident cells differ from infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages by the specific expression of several markers, including ADGRE1 (F4/80), GATA6 and TIMD4 [26–29, 31, 34–36]. Our data show that human pMPHs also express much higher levels of these marker genes than MDMs (Figure 1D, 1E), suggesting that these markers may also be applicable to human cells. TAMs and pMPHs showed very similar expression patterns of these markers, consistent with the hypothesis that pMPHs are a major origin of TAMs. However, it cannot be ruled out that infiltrating monocytes are converted to TAMs resembling pMPHs by tumor-borne mediators.
        Previous work has identified TAMs as the major source of a number of pro-tumorigenic or immune suppressive protein mediators within the ovarian cancer microenvironment [38], The data presented here show that the corresponding genes are expressed at similar levels in TAMs and pMPHs, while their expression is lower in MDMs in most cases (Figure 2D). It is therefore likely that some pro-tumorigenic effects mediated by TAMs reflect functions of pMPHs rather than tumor-induced alterations.
        Our data also confirm the previously described refractoriness of TAMs to inflammatory stimuli [7, 20–23, 47], exemplified by the unresponsiveness of the IL12B gene to LPS and INFγ in ovarian cancer TAMs (Figure 4D, 4E). Since pMPHs are principally inducible by pro-inflammatory stimuli (Figure 4D, E) and the induction of proinflammatory genes in MDMs is repressed by ascites (as shown for IL12B in Supplementary Figure S8), it is likely that the observed lack of TAMs to LPS and INFγ is caused by the tumor microenvironment. This suggests that ovarian cancer ascites affects macrophage functions to varying degrees, with phagocytosis and antigen presentation remaining intact and inflammatory responses being suppressed. The molecular mechanisms underlying this repression remain obscure, as the comparative RNA-Seq data did not provide insights into the transcriptional signaling pathways affected.
      
      
        Upregulation of ECM remodeling genes in TAMs
        Our study identified an ECM gene cluster as a specific feature of ovarian cancer TAMs (Figures 5 and Figure 6), suggesting that TAMs figure in collagen deposition, fibrillogenesis and ECM remodeling. In this context it is noteworthy that fibrillar collagen has been shown to enhance the invasive properties of tumor cells by accelerating their movement along these fibers and macrophages clearly enhance cancer cell invasion [6, 24]. Macrophages are also indispensable for mouse mammary gland development owing to their critical function in promoting collagen fibrillogenesis [57].
        A number of published observations have linked the products of several of the ECM cluster genes to macrophage-mediated matrix remodeling and cancer cell invasion [24]. Apart from the collagens, other proteins encoded by the ECM cluster with instrumental functions in matrix deposition and remodeling include (i) lumican (LUM), which regulates collagen fibril organization and growth [58, 59], (ii) lysyl oxidase (LOX) with crucial functions in the cross-linking of ECM proteins [60] and (iii) procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 2 (PCOLCE2), which promotes the enzymatic cleavage of type I procollagen to yield mature structured fibrils [61, 62]. Importantly, PCOLCE2 protein was detectable at appreciable levels in the ascites of ovarian cancer patients (Figure 6D).
      
      
        Clinical relevance of ECM remodelling
        On the basis of our observations it is tempting to speculate that TAMs support tumor cell adherence and invasion by secreting ECM remodeling proteins. Such a scenario is indeed strongly supported by a mouse model of transcoelomic ovarian cancer dissemination, which showed a clear dependence of peritoneal colonization on macrophage-mediated effects on the ECM through metalloproteinase 9 [63]. Furthermore, other researchers showed that macrophage depletion in mice resulted in decreased ascites formation and peritoneal colonization [64–66].
        Tumor cell spheroids from ovarian cancer ascites can adhere to, disintegrate and spread on ECM components [67, 68], suggesting that the macrophage-triggered reorganization of collagen deposition may promote ovarian cancer cell invasion. This result is consistent with previous observations associating ECM remodeling genes with a poor clinical course of ovarian cancer [51, 69–73]. For example, Cheon et al [69]. described a relapse-associated signature that consists of genes coding for collagen/ECM remodeling proteins. Intriguingly, this signature is regulated by TGFβ1 signaling as predicted for the ECM cluster identified in the present work (Figure 4D).
        Busuttil and colleagues [71] identified a “stromal-response” signature in ovarian cancer that is associated with poor survival and enriched for genes encoding inflammatory and extracellular matrix proteins expressed by the tumor-associated stroma. Furthermore, the mesenchymal subtype of ovarian HGSC, characterized by the upregulation of ECM remodeling genes, has the worst clinical outcome of all subtypes [72, 73]. Our observations extend these findings by providing compelling evidence that genes associated with ECM restructuring are coordinately upregulated in ovarian cancer TAMs. This may explain, at least in part, the critical role of macrophages in ovarian cancer progression [4, 74].
      
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Patient samples
        Clinical samples (Supplementary Table S5) were obtained from untreated patients undergoing surgery for ovarian carcinoma (mostly HGSC) or hysterectomy for non-malignant diseases lacking peritoneal effusions. Informed consent was obtained from all patients according to the protocols approved by the local ethics committee. All experiments were conducted in agreement with the Helsinki declaration.
      
      
        Isolation and culture of primary immune cells
        Macrophages were isolated from ascites (TAMs) or peritoneal lavage fluids (pMPHs) by density gradient centrifugation (Lymphocyte Separation Medium 1077; PromoCell) and subsequent enrichment on magnetic CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech). Tumor cells and CD3+ T cells were isolated as described [38]. MDMs were generated from monocytes (6-day differentiation for RNA experiments, 10-day cultures for flow cytometry) from healthy donors as described [75] and in RPMI with human AB serum.
      
      
        Flow cytometry analysis of macrophages
        TAMs from malignant ascites or pMPHs from peritoneal lavage fluid were stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD14 (Miltenyi Biotech), APC-labeled anti-CD206 (BioLegend), APC-labeled anti-HLA-DR or APC-labeled anti-CD206 (Biozol), PE-labeled anti-CD163, PE-labeled anti-CD64, PE-Cy7-labeled anti-CD16 and APC-labeled anti-CD32 (eBioscience) as described previously [4]. Intracellular staining was performed with PE-labeled anti-IL-10 (BD Biosciences) after permeabilization for 20 min at 4 C using BD Cytofix Cytoperm Plus Fixation Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences). Additionally, APC-labeled anti-CD52 or APC-labeled anti-TIMD4 (Biolegend) was used for surface staining of TAMs and MDMs from healthy donors. Isotype control antibodies were from BD Biosciences, Miltenyi Biotech and eBioscience. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and results were calculated as percentage of positive cells and mean fluorescence intensities (MFI).
      
      
        ELISA of ascites
        Concentrations of PCOLCE 2 in ascites from ovarian cancer patients were determined using an ELISA Kit from Biozol according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
      
      
        T cell activation
        Antigen-specific T cell activation by macrophages was determined essentially as described [75]. In brief, MDMs or TAMs were loaded with 1μg/ml CEFT peptide pool (jpt Peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany) as recall antigens and incubated with a 5-fold excess of lymphocytes for 18 h in the presence of Brefeldin A (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). Lymphocytes were harvested and stained with anti-CD8-APC (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and after permeabilization with anti-IFNγ-FITC (eBioscience, Frankfurt, Germany). Flow cytometry (FACS Canto, BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) data were expressed as IFNγ+/CD8+ cells after subtracting background staining of non-stimulated controls.
      
      
        Analysis of phagocytosis
        Phagocytotic capacity was determined by incubating macrophages with pHrodo® Red E. coli BioParticles conjugate (Thermo Fisher) for 15 min in R10AB medium and subsequent quantification by flow cytometry.
      
      
        RT-qPCR
        Isolation of total RNA and RT-qPCR were carried out as described [76], using the following primers:

        RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq)
        RNA-Seq was performed as described [75]. Sequencing data were deposited at EBI ArrayExpress (E-MTAB-3167, E-MTAB-3398, E-MTAB-4162, E-MTAB-4764). Genome assembly and gene model data were retrieved from Ensembl release 81, hg38. RNA-Seq data were aligned using STAR (version STAR_2.3.1z13_r470) [77]. Gene read counts were established and TPM (transcripts per million) values were calculated as published [75]. Adjustment of RNA-Seq data for contaminating tumor and T cells was performed as describe [38]. Batch effects were removed using Bioconductor tool ComBat [78, 79] after filtering all genes with a variance <1.
      
      
        Identification of regulated genes
        RNA-Seq data (Supplementary Dataset S1) were filtered for genes with minimum TPM values of 3 and median TPM ratios TAM/TAT >0.1 and TAM/tumor cells >0.1. For the delineation of genes selectively up- or down-regulated in TAMs we applied the Bioconductor package edgeR [48, 49] and identified a group of 21 genes expressed at significantly different levels in TAMs versus pMPHs (FDR = 0.2; Supplementary Table S1). We then used this gene set to identify additional genes showing highly correlated expression patterns across all TAM samples (r >0.9) and no overlaps of TAM and pMPH samples using the upper and lower quartiles, respectively, as thresholds. Upregulated genes were defined by 2-fold higher median TPM values in TAMs versus pMPH, or vice versa for down-regulated genes. This resulted in the definition of extended datasets of 30 genes upregulated and 4 genes downregulated in TAMs (Supplementary Dataset S2 and Supplementary Dataset S3). Similar analyses performed for with TAMs and MDMs (Supplementary Table S2) lead to extended datasets of 497 upregulated genes.
      
      
        Statistical and bioinformatic analyses
        Flow cytometry, ELISA and RT-qPCR data were statistically analyzed by Student's t-test (two-sided, equal variance). Results are shown as follows: *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001. Quantiles, confidence intervals and correlation coefficients were calculated using the Python functions pandas.DataFrame.boxplot () and scipy.stats.pearsonr (), respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the scipy.cluster.hierarchy functions linkage (method=“weighted”, metric=“correlation”) and dendrogram (). Gene sets were analyzed for Upstream Regulators using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database (Qiagen Redwood City, CA, USA) as described [75]. Functional annotations were performed by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (http://geneontology.org).

        Proteins, as executives of genes' instructions, are responsible for cellular phenotypes. Integrating proteomics with gene microarray, we conducted this study to identify potential protein biomarkers of colorectal cancer (CRC). Isobaric tags with related and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling mass spectrometry (MS) was applied to screen and identify differentially expressed proteins between paired CRC and adjacent normal mucosa. Meanwhile, Affymetrix U133plus2.0 microarrays were used to perform gene microarray analysis. Verification experiments included immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of selected proteins. Overall, 5469 differentially expressed proteins were detected with iTRAQ-MS from 24 matched CRC and adjacent normal tissues. And gene microarray identified 39859 differential genes from 52 patients. Of these, 3083 differential proteins had corresponding differentially expressed genes, with 245 proteins and their genes showed >1.5-fold change in expression level. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that up-regulated proteins were more involved in cell adhesion and motion than down-regulated proteins. In addition, up-regulated proteins were more likely to be located in nucleus and vesicles. Further verification experiments with IHC confirmed differential expression levels of 5 proteins (S100 calcium-binding protein A9, annexin A3, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, carboxylesterase 2 and calcium activated chloride channel A1) between CRC and normal tissues. Besides, western blot showed a stepwise increase of annexin A3 abundance in normal colorectal mucosa, adenoma and CRC tissues. ELISA results revealed significantly higher serum levels of S100 calcium-binding protein A9 and annexin A3 in CRC patients than healthy controls, validating diagnostic value of these proteins. Cell experiments showed that inhibition of annexin A3 could suppress CRC cell proliferation and aggressiveness. S100 calcium-binding protein A9, annexin A3, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, carboxylesterase 2 and calcium activated chloride channel A1 were probably potential biomarkers of colorectal cancer. Annexin A3 was a potentially valuable therapeutic target of CRC.
      
    
      INTRODUCTION
      According to statistics of World Health Organization (WHO), colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide, with it being the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths [1]. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advancements, CRC survival rate has hardly changed over the last two decades, with over 50% of patients having regional or distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis [1]. However, 5-year survival rates of patients in different stages vary dramatically, from more than 90% in stage I to less than 10% in stage IV [1, 2]. Additionally, as a heterogeneous disease, almost every patient of CRC has his/her specific features. Therefore, early detection and individual treatment are of great significance for CRC. Screening and identifying new biomarkers are warranted to better diagnose, treat, predict and monitor recurrence of CRC.
      In the last decade, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has elucidated genomic characteristics of human cancers including glioblastoma [3], ovarian cancer [4], lung cancer [5], breast cancer [6], colorectal cancer [7] and endometrial carcinoma [8]. As executives of genes' instructions, proteins are responsible for cellular phenotypes. Since the existence of post-transcriptional and -translational modifications, cancer proteomics is more complex than genomics. However, so far, there are few integrative analyses of proteomic and genomic data for cancers including CRC, which presents an urgent need to integrate proteomics with genomics to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of bioinformation flow in cancer cells.
      In this study, we applied high-throughput proteomics integrated with gene microarray to screen and identify potential biomarkers of CRC. Isobaric tags with related and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling mass spectrometry (MS) was used as proteomic tool. Meanwhile Affymetrix U133plus2.0 microarrays were applied as gene microarray analysis method. In total, we identified and quantitated 3083 proteins/genes expressed simultaneously in paired colorectal cancer (CRC) and adjacent normal mucosa by iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS and gene microarray, among which 245 proteins showed >1.5-fold change in expression level. In addition, expression levels of 24 proteins amongst the 245 proteins were significantly different (P<0.05) between paired CRC and adjacent normal mucosa independent of cancer stage, which were confirmed in the validation set. Subsequent immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments validated that S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), annexin A3 (ANXA3), nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) and calcium activated chloride channel A1 (CLCA1) were differentially expressed between paired CRC and adjacent normal samples (P<0.05). Besides, using western blotting, we observed that expression level of ANXA3 increased stepwise in normal colorectal mucosa, adenoma and CRC tissues.
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Differential protein expression profiling with iTRAQ-MS
        iTRAQ-MS was used to screen and identify proteins expressed differently between paired CRC and adjacent normal colonic mucosa from 24 patients (Table 1). The median age of the patients was 62.8 years old and 75% were male. Five pooled-samples (stage I, stage II, stage III, stage IV and adjacent normal sample) were obtained and labeled with one of the iTRAQ tags 113, 114, 116, 115, and 117, respectively.
